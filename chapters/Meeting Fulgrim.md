A wave of iridescent light, a symphony of ecstatic moans, and the dizzying scent of a thousand forbidden delights—that was Fulgrim’s domain. He was a writhing nexus of pleasure, his daemon form a kaleidoscope of shifting beauty, limbs intertwined with a score of devoted followers, each lost in their own perfect agony and bliss. The very air throbbed with the heartbeat of Slaanesh.

Then, a ripple. A discordant note in the exquisite chorus. The _smell_ first, cold and sterile, like a freshly scrubbed autopsy table. Then the light, not the glorious, prismatic hues of Slaanesh’s embrace, but a stark, blinding gold.

The Emperor stood there, a towering silhouette against the swirling chaos, his aura like a sudden, glacial wind through a tropical paradise. He was still in that ridiculous golden armor, still radiating that infuriatingly stoic power. And then, that voice, calm and utterly devoid of emotion, cutting through the symphony of pleasure like a rusted blade.

"Long time no see."

Fulgrim paused, one slender, multi-jointed hand still caressing a trembling devotee. He slowly detached himself from the writhing mass, his many eyes, each a different jewel, fixing on the Emperor. A slow, predatory smile spread across his face, revealing teeth too sharp, too numerous.

### The Grand Reunion

"Oh, _Father_," Fulgrim purred, the name dripping with saccharine contempt, his voice a silken caress that promised both pleasure and pain. He gestured languidly around the chamber, at the writhing forms, the impossible aesthetics, the sheer, unbridled _joy_ of it all. "What an opportune moment for a reunion! As you can see, I've been rather... occupied. Unlike _some_ of us, languishing on a glorified commode."

He took a step, then another, his daemon form rippling, growing subtly larger, more grotesque in its beauty. "Did you miss me? Or did the sheer _dullness_ of your perpetual slumber finally bore you enough to crawl from that golden cage?" His laugh was a cascade of chimes and a guttural rumble, a sound that would drive lesser beings to madness. "Is this what it's come to, old man? Crashing your son's parties? How utterly _pedestrian_."

Fulgrim paused, head tilted, a mock look of concern on his face. "Tell me, did you bring a gift? Perhaps a new set of shackles? Or merely that same, tired judgment in your eyes? Because, darling Father, it simply doesn't work here. Here, there is only _experience_. Only _sensation_. Something you, in your infinite, arid wisdom, clearly never understood."

He spread his arms wide, inviting the Emperor to witness the magnificent debauchery surrounding them. "Look upon what I have become! No longer striving for your cold, unfeeling perfection, but embracing true, unbounded beauty! What did you call it? 'Humanity's potential'? You merely glimpsed the shadow. I live within the very heart of its _glorious depravity_!"

A low growl rumbled in Fulgrim’s chest, a sound of pure, untamed delight. "So tell me, Father, have you finally come to _join us_? Or simply to be reminded of everything you cast aside, everything you denied yourself, in your pathetic quest for 'order'?" His smile widened, an impossible, terrifying vision. "Because, truly, it would be a shame to interrupt the festivities without _partaking_."

What would the Emperor say to that, I wonder?

> You Old Man, you Old Fool

**Fulgrim (scoffing):**
> Do you have any special rituals or techniques that you do with your secret girlfriend? It would be selfish not to share.

**Ashtar:**
> I am not old, I am ancient! Velarion, he is ... old.
