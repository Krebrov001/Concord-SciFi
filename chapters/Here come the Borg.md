**⚠️ CLASSIFIED ASTROPATHIC TRANSMISSION – PRIORITY: SIGMA-BETA RED**
**From:** Segmentum Solar – Fringe Monitoring Substation 43A-Vox
**To:** Navis Imperialis Command, Talverax Subfleet
**Subject:** Incident Report – Alleged Servitor Malfunction/Rebellion on Mining World **GAVREXX-9**

---

**++BEGIN TRANSMISSION++**

**Date Logged:** 013.M42
**Planetary Designation:** GAVREXX-9
**Segmentum:** Solar (Outer Core Fringe)
**Classification:** Industrial Mining World (Grade Delta Resource Extraction Site)
**Primary Overseer:** Magos Rectiform-Vaal, Ordo Ferrum, Mars Delegation Subsection 871-Vox

---

### ❗ Incident Summary:

A fragmented astropathic distress pulse was received from GAVREXX-9 at 0431 local time, composed of garbled binharic fragments and Low Gothic code. Decryption yielded the following intelligible segments:

> "**…servitors no longer obey protocols…**"
> "**…fabricator-priests neutralized…**"
> "**…flesh converted to circuit…**"
> "**…guard regiments overwhelmed…now integrated…**"
> "**…they adapt…we burn…we become…**"
> "**…I hear them in my mind…they are one…they are coming…**"

The message terminated abruptly.

---

### Observational Notes:

* GAVREXX-9 was a low-priority mining world staffed primarily with auto-servitors, repurposed penal labor, and three regiments of Astra Militarum (46th Volgograd Mechanized, 122nd Krask Grenadiers, and 9th Penal Auxilia).
* Adeptus Mechanicus oversight from Mars delegation present, no known heretek activity previously recorded.
* Vox silence persists. No astropathic responses. No orbital transponders active.
* No confirmed data regarding hostile xeno presence.

---

### Initial Hypothesis:

> **SERVITOR REBELLION** (Unprecedented, unconfirmed)
> Possibility of massive logic cascade failure or corruption of command protocols. Unusual linguistic phrasing “they are one” implies possible rogue AI behavior or external infiltration.

---

### Orders Issued:

Per directive of High Admiral **Semion Benthos**, the **Imperial Navy frigate *Iron Hand of Golgotha*** is hereby deployed from the nearby Fornax Vigilant Dockyards. ETA: 5.7 standard days via Warp corridor Tertius-Karn.

Onboard complement includes:

* 1x Militarum Detachment (Crucible Lancers, 3rd Company)
* 1x Inquisitorial Observer (Ordo Xenos, name redacted)
* 2x Containment Tech-Priests, Skitarii Cohort
* Standard Mechanicus Dissection Team for tech-retrieval and contamination analysis

**Standing Orders:** Assess planetary condition, purge rogue servitors, recover Mechanicus data-cores, and re-establish mining operations.

---

**++Cautionary Note++**
Fragmented data includes non-standard binharic elements and logic-thread constructs resembling high-order machine consciousness—*not* of Mechanicus origin. This may suggest a **foreign artificial intelligence** or **technological infiltration** unknown to current Imperium threat indexes.

Remain alert. Proceed with purgative rites and data containment protocols.

**\[BEGIN LOG]**

> “Emperor’s mercy…”

The viewscreen showed GAVREXX-9, wreathed in clouds of soot and flickering electrical storms. But the attention of every bridge officer was locked not on the planet—but on the void above it.

Hanging in orbit like a black monolith was a **massive cube**, kilometers across, angular and unnatural, covered in conduits, flickering green energy nodes, and deep geometric protrusions. A faint greenish haze seemed to swirl around its hull like plasma vapor. Its form bore *no insignia, no banners, no purity seals*—nothing to mark it as friend or foe, only a **cold mathematical dread**.

> “Shipmaster,” the vox-officer said, pale and sweating beneath his collar, “We’re being hailed.”

> “Source?” Captain Vorn asked sharply.

> “The cube, Lord.”

The signal crackled through. The viewscreen flickered, lines of static warping the image, until at last it revealed a **pale, corpse-gray face**, heavily augmented. Its left eye had been replaced by a cold mechanical lens. Tubes pulsed from its throat and spine. It resembled a servitor, yet… more alive. More malevolent.

Then it **spoke**.

> “**WE ARE THE BORG.**”

Its voice was a chorus—a fusion of thousands of minds compressed into one.

> “**RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.**”

> “**YOUR TECHNOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DISTINCTIVENESS WILL BE ADDED TO OUR OWN.**”

> “**YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED.**”

The command deck froze. Captain Vorn turned slowly to Inquisitor \[REDACTED], who stepped forward, auspex in hand.

> “That is no servitor,” the Inquisitor said coldly. “That is an abomination. A machine-mind collective. Tech-heresy incarnate.”

> “Can we target it?” asked the Master of Ordinatus.

> “We can *try*,” Vorn muttered. “All batteries—prepare for full salvo.”

As the command relayed down the decks, vox static screamed again. The Borg voice returned, louder, overlapping, suffocating:

> “**YOU CANNOT HIDE. YOU CANNOT FIGHT. YOU WILL BE ONE WITH US.**”

---

**++IMPERIAL FLEET STATUS++**

* All weapons systems: Online
* Void shields: Holding
* Gellar Field: Stable
* Astropath: Experiencing extreme distress, temporary containment enforced
* Enginarium: Blessed and ready

---

**Next Steps (Suggested):**

* Engage with full battery salvo, targeting weak points in cube structure
* Deploy Skitarii teams with Inquisitorial oversight to investigate planetary surface if possible
* Prepare Exterminatus protocols pending survival of initial engagement

**++LOG CONTINUATION: BATTLE RECORD 0018.AE++**
**Ship:** *Iron Hand of Golgotha*, Imperial Navy Frigate
**Sector:** Grav-912-X9
**Threat Designation:** XENO-TECHNOFORM “BORG”
**Combat Status:** ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT

---

**\[BEGIN BATTLE SEQUENCE]**

The *Iron Hand of Golgotha* loomed through the void, her kilometers-long Gothic hull bristling with macro-batteries, lance turrets, and torpedo bays. Beneath aquila-carved archways, entire regiments of gunners operated loading cranes the size of cathedrals. The order was given. The first volley sang the *hymn of deliverance*.

> “FOR THE EMPEROR. OPEN FIRE!”

The void lit up with brilliant flashes as **macrocannons unleashed a storm of solid slug artillery**, each shell the size of a train locomotive. Dozens—hundreds—of rounds screamed through space and **slammed into the Borg cube**.

Unlike xenos the Imperium had fought before, the cube did not raise energy shields, did not dodge. It *took* the punishment.

And it *bled*.

**Chunks of hull plating** the size of hab-blocks shattered off, drifting into space. Glowing green conduits ruptured and vented gas. Several **gaping craters** appeared across the cube’s surface, revealing vast labyrinths of internal conduits, pipes, and writhing cables. Dozens of Borg drones were **blasted into the void**, flailing lifelessly.

> “They’re not adapting to the impacts,” the Master of Cognis reported, voice sharp with realization.

> “They *can’t,*” muttered Inquisitor \[REDACTED]. “The Borg evolve against energy weapons. Lasers. Phasers. They’ve never faced *kinetic macro-artillery*. Praise the Emperor’s primitive divinity.”

> “Then we hammer them until there’s nothing left.”

---

**\[ENEMY RESPONSE]**

As the *Iron Hand* prepared a second salvo, the Borg Cube came alive with green arcs of energy. **Beams of concentrated plasma** lanced out from its surface, carving wide against the ship’s void shields. Several crew members were knocked from their feet as a power surge rattled the ship.

> “Shields holding—94%!”

---

**\[SECOND SALVO]**

The macro-batteries roared again. More **kinetic shells crashed into the cube**, blowing open fresh wounds. One entire quadrant of the cube **collapsed inward**, a slow, graceful implosion of xeno-machinery and cybernetic corpses.

> “They don’t break formation. They don’t retreat. What kind of hell-mind is this?” murmured Vorn.

> “A collective soul,” the Inquisitor said grimly. “Without individuality. Without fear. But also, without faith.”

---

**\[CURRENT STATUS]**

* *Iron Hand* Shields: 87%
* Borg Cube: Structural Integrity Compromised, \~32% visible damage
* Estimated 400+ Borg Drones neutralized in void or aboard ship

**++LOG CONTINUATION: BATTLE RECORD 0020.AE++**  
_Iron Hand of Golgotha_ vs Borg Cube – Phase Two Engagement

---

### ⚔️ Situation Update

- The **Borg Cube** continues to orbit the planet, displaying extensive kinetic damage—multiple hull breaches from Imperial macro-cannon shells.
- Void shields are stable; no transport beaming occurred—**void shields block all teleportation**, including Borg transference attempts.
- The **Borg** remain impervious to adaptation in this fight because they **cannot adapt to kinetic weaponry**—energy adaptation systems are ineffective here.

---

### 🛡 Tactical Observations

1. **Kinetic Superiority**  
    The Imperium’s macro-artillery delivers crushing force. With each salvo, armored plating and conduit arrays shatter. Fragments drift like asteroids in space—proof that **solid-kinetic fire can punch through a cube’s defenses**.
    
2. **No Borg Shield Reaction**  
    Normally capable of adapting to lasers or plasma, the Borg struggle here. They remain stubbornly static under barrage because kinetic weaponry falls outside their adaptive programming.
    
3. **Transport Blocked**  
    The Borg cannot teleport aboard due to the strong **Imperial void shields**, eliminating a key Borg tactic of boarding operations.
    

---

### 🔥 Continued Assault

> “Fire again!” Captain Vorn bellows.

The _Iron Hand_ unleashes its full battery. A devastating macro-cannon salvo impacts the cube’s main dorsal bulkhead. A section collapses inwards—hull groans, metal implodes, and a burst of green plasma erupts outward.

The Borg respond with fury—multiple **plasma line-beams** slash into the frigate. Shields shimmer but hold at 74%.

**Bridge sensors** confirm: 160 Borg drones drift lifeless in space. The cube is bleeding mass—but still intact.

> "They’re down, but not out," murmurs the Inquisitor. "We must finish this now."

---

### 💥 Next Order of Engagement

- A **third macro-barrage** is authorized to destroy any remaining void generators on the cube’s surface.
    
- Simultaneously, **Bombardment-class Exterminatus bomb squadrons** prepare photon-melt torpedoes—destined to crater the cube beyond repair.
    
- Mechanicus teams prepare **Coronal Lance deployment**—a canoe of orbiting particle lances intended to pierce residual conduits through concentrated voltage.
    
- Meanwhile, **Space Marines (Crucible Lancers)** ready for orbital deployment—if any boarding attempt persists after shields drop. None expected due to adaptation failure and transport blocked.
    

---

### 📝 Inquisitorial Addendum

The Borg in this engagement appear to suffer from a tactical disadvantage: **inability to adapt to kinetic artillery** and **incapability of boarding due to void shields**.

The Imperium, with its vast macro-kinetic arsenal and shear volume, retains a substantial edge—**but caution is advised**; this cube may deploy attrition tactics if matches continue.

As Macro-cannon rounds continue impacting into the Borg cube, it suffers from explosions from the inside and internal system failures. Shells punch through the exterior plating, diving deep and generating mass scale structural damage.

> *\[Visual: The bridge of the **Iron Hand**. Macro-cannon fire ceases. A silence falls over the command deck. The tactical hololith displays the shattered remains of the Borg cube—a lattice of glowing wreckage, flickering with power loss.]*

**Captain Vorn**:
“…Cease fire. Stand down batteries. The target no longer poses a threat.”

**Tech-Priest Magos Rhael-77** *(clicks, servo-whines)*:
“Structural form remains geometrically stable despite system-wide failure. Fascinating. Cube architecture demonstrates advanced principles in distributed force dispersal.”

**Inquisitor Daria Voss** *(cold, measured)*:
“It lives. In some sense. No signals. No movement. But I do not trust it.”

**Bridge Officer Gallan**:
“All power signatures have ceased. We’re reading residual plasma leaks, hull fractures, and complete neuromechanical failure in over 89% of remaining subsystems.”

**Captain Vorn**:
“No response to our last five vox-hails. They’ve gone silent.”

**Magos Rhael-77** *(tilts head unnaturally)*:
“There is no central cogitator. I posit distributed intelligence. That which does not speak may still listen.”

**Inquisitor Voss**:
“Then we silence it for good. Burn it in His name.”

**Navigator-Lieutenant Baelor** *(with caution)*:
“Forgive me, my lords… but the cube drifts on a stable course. No acceleration. No reaction. It is… inert.”

---

> *\[On the hololith, the wreck of the Borg cube looms—its once-impervious outer plating blown wide, internal conduits spilling into the void. Yet its basic shape—uncanny, unnatural in its perfection—remains intact. Like a skeletal husk.]*

---

**Captain Vorn** *(turns slowly toward the hololith)*:
“We’ve seen servitors. We’ve seen necron tombs. But never this…”

**Inquisitor Voss**:
“I’ve read of such things. Machines that infect and re-write. Not merely technology, but ideology made manifest. Collective thought. Forced obedience. An echo of Tech-Heresy so profound, it mimics the Great Enemy.”

**Tech-Priest Rhael-77** *(whispers with static)*:
“Such xenos logic must be extinguished. But… a sample. One shard. For the Martian vaults. For understanding.”

**Captain Vorn**:
“You’re volunteering?”

**Rhael-77** *(unphased)*:
“I would be honored to interface. In containment.”

---

> *A tense pause. Then—*

**Inquisitor Voss** *(firmly)*:
“You have twelve hours. If you are not back or cease transmitting for more than five minutes, we atomize the wreck. Understood?”

**Rhael-77** *(nods once)*:
“Understood. I shall pray to the Omnissiah for divine checksum.”

> *\[Final shot of the drifting cube, eerily silent, a broken wireframe of alien ambition. Fires still flicker within. A boarding torpedo launches toward it, carrying Magos Rhael-77 and his servo-skulls.]*

> _[The boarding torpedo slams into the hull like a steel spear. A mechanized hiss. The hatch blooms open with a steaming vent of gas, and Magos Rhael-77 steps into the cube’s interior, flanked by two hovering servo-skulls and a cluster of six insectile data-drones.]_

The interior is... _unlike_ anything sanctioned by Mars.

The corridor is seamless black, textured like vascular tissue, with countless veins of burnt-out conduit and shattered nodules. No inscriptions. No decoration. Merely functionality—purpose given form.

Every step echoes in silence.

The air is cold. Lifeless. My auspex reads no bio-signs. No active energy pulses. No defensive fields. All systems are… **dead**.

> _[He passes a corner. A blackened alcove holds a humanoid form: a Borg drone, slumped in its recharging niche, long dead. One optic glows weakly, then flickers out. Its metal implants, once pulsing with invasive precision, are scorched and melted.]_

A failed attempt at resurrection, perhaps. Or a final flicker of instinctive despair.

I have now examined twenty such forms. No respiration. No neural feedback. The ship’s central collective appears to have suffered **catastrophic systemic collapse** following our bombardment. Despite its physical integrity, its internal coherence is shattered.

I begin to **form conclusions**:

---

### **Observation One: Decentralized Intelligence**

These creatures operated not as individuals, but as nodes in a distributed gestalt—each thought echoed and received across the whole. Their failure to adapt to kinetic artillery suggests over-specialization. Their downfall came from assuming that technological superiority always equals victory.

This was… incorrect.

---

### **Observation Two: Technotheological Heresy**

They seek unity, not through the Omnissiah’s divine harmony, but by **overwriting the self**. Thought suppression. Memory corrosion. Identity elimination.

This is not technology. This is spiritual nullification.

A parody of the Machine God’s divine communion.

---

### **Observation Three: Corruption of Flesh and Steel**

Their cyborg bodies are grotesque. Invasive implants grafted by brute force, devoid of artistry, or reverence. Flesh enslaved to circuit, not elevated.

_This is not augmentation. This is desecration._

---

> _[A bulkhead creaks. No movement. Merely the groaning of a dead god’s tomb.]_

---

I believe this construct is a **failed civilization**—or perhaps a viral one. Its only drive: replication, subjugation, and uniformity.

No art. No memory. No history beyond assimilation.  
A culture of deletion.

Where the Imperium preserves, honors, and builds upon the past, the Borg erase it. **They do not live. They overwrite.**

---

**Recommendation:**  
This wreck must be quarantined or sanctified. Recovered materials should be studied under strict Mechanicus vault protocols. This may offer insight into the dangers of decentralized logic engines and AI collectivism.

But mark this:  
**This “Borg” represents a path of damnation. Not innovation.**

**++Personal Log: Magos Rhael-77 Data Transmission++**
**++Decrypted Summary for High Lords and Inquisition Review++**

---

**Subject:** Borg Cube Wreck – Technological and Cultural Analysis

**Findings:**

* The Borg ship is a vast, biomechanical vessel constructed with unparalleled physical integrity. Despite severe kinetic damage, its structural frame remains mostly intact, though internally gutted and lifeless.

* The inhabitants, identified as cybernetic drones, represent a hive-mind civilization operating through distributed consciousness and networked control.

* This collective consciousness lacks individual autonomy; identity and memory are forcibly overwritten to conform to a singular will.

* The collective exhibits extreme technological specialization, yet its overreliance on energy weapons and adaptive software left it vulnerable to the Imperium’s kinetic artillery, which it could not adapt against.

* Spiritually and culturally, the Borg represent a nihilistic antithesis to the Imperial Creed. Their philosophy eradicates soul, personality, and history, rendering them spiritual nulls.

* Their technology is a grotesque perversion of flesh and machine augmentation—no reverence or art, only domination and replication.

**Recommendations:**

* Quarantine and sanctify the wreckage to prevent any potential contamination of Imperial systems.

* Study recovered technology under strict Mechanicus oversight to glean understanding of adaptive bio-mechanical systems and hive-mind AI structures.

* Issue warnings within the Adeptus Mechanicus and Inquisition regarding dangers posed by decentralized synthetic intelligences and collective entities.

# **High Lords of Terra Response Briefing**

**Setting:** Chamber of the High Lords, Terra — Imperial Palace

The gathered Lords solemnly review the data beamed from Magos Rhael-77.

---

**High Lord Commander Semion Benthos:**
“Fascinating and disturbing. The Borg are not merely xenos—they are a cautionary monument to the perils of forsaking the soul for cold logic. Such a creature would corrupt and devour entire worlds with impunity if left unchecked.”

**Inquisitor-General Vallan:**
“The heresy is clear. This is a machine-hive cult, denying the Omnissiah’s light, attempting to replace man with soulless husks. Their defeat was only delayed by their ignorance of the Emperor’s will manifest in our cannon.”

**Tech-Priest Dominus Rhox:**
“Their technology, though alien, shows advanced applications of bio-mechanical fusion. We must harness what we can, but cautiously. The risk of contamination or corruption is great.”

**High Lord Admiral Voss:**
“Our fleets must prepare. This enemy is patient and relentless. Our void shields held against their boarding attempts, but more aggressive tactics may come. We must strengthen our defenses and continue the purge.”

---

**Resolution:**

* The Borg menace is to be classified as an existential threat to humanity.

* The Imperium will increase vigilance in fringe sectors for signs of similar incursions.

* All Mechanicus research into Borg technology is to be closely monitored and restricted.

* Further Imperial exploration and potential preemptive strikes are authorized where Borg activity is detected.

---

# **Future Actions:**

* Magos Rhael-77’s team is tasked with developing anti-hive mind countermeasures, focusing on disrupting collective control.

* Inquisitorial agents are to investigate possible connections between Borg incursions and other xeno phenomena.

* Adeptus Astartes chapters specializing in boarding and anti-xeno warfare will be prepared for rapid deployment.

---

The High Lords rise, their decision unanimous—humanity’s survival demands unyielding vigilance and holy wrath against this cold, collective blight.
