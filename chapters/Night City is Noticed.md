> *"By the Golden Throne… what wretched hive of arrogance and apostasy is this?”*  
> — Canoness Joryn Malcaste, upon reviewing vid-feeds of Night City

**+++ Summary +++**  
Initial data intercepted from exploratory astropathic sweep over a rogue M-class planet in the **Galactic Mid-Rim**, code-named **"Nyte-9-Eta"**, reveals an urbanized sprawl-world identified by local denizens as **Night City**.

Confirmed: Human origin.  
Unconfirmed: Connection to the Imperium or compliance records.  
Presumed: Lost fragment of a DAoT-era expeditionary culture, never recovered.

### 🔍 Observations:

- Full planetary dominance by **megacorporate fiefdoms**.  
- No presence of Ecclesiarchy, Imperial Creed, or compliance symbols.  
- High ratio of **cybernetic augmentation**, often elective, not corrective — suggesting **flesh-denialist cultism**.
- Rampant degeneracy: open displays of **carnal commerce**, **narcotic excess**, **neural entertainment loops**, **sexualized AI constructs**, and **gene-plasm marketeering**.
- State-sanctioned **organ trade**, **digital limb exchange**, and **identity fracturing** for profit.

**Designation Recommended:**  
> *Techno-Heretic Degenerate Human Subclass – Non-Compliant.  
Potential Target for Exterminatus upon resource availability.*

### 🧠 Thought for the Day:
> *"Man was not made to ascend by wire and silicon, but by faith and flame."*

---

**🛑 Official Statement: Adeptus Ministorum Sub-Sector Voxcast**

> *"What we have seen here is not civilization, but a mockery of Mankind's purpose. A living shrine to techno-pride, where flesh is traded for convenience and the machine-spirit is defiled daily. This ‘Night City’ is a relic not of progress, but of humanity's fall — the same fall that led us to the Age of Strife."*

> *"They spit on the God-Emperor’s truth, replacing faith with fashion, community with code, virtue with vice. Their augmetics are not to heal, but to exalt vanity. Their rulers are not saints, but advertisers. Their children are raised by algorithms. This city is not alive. It is already a corpse."*

---

### 🎙️ MILITARUM COMMENTARY:

**Lord General Vorth Radomir, Cadian 54th,** upon receiving holopict scans:

> *“This world would’ve been glassed within hours if not for our current engagements across six fronts. In another age, we’d have sent ten regiments of Guard, two wings of Sisters, and a Black Templar strike force to cleanse it and plant a cathedral in its ashes.”*

---

### ⚔️ PRIORITY DELAY: ACTIVE CAMPAIGNS INCLUDE

- **Segmentum Ultima:** Tyranid splinter fleet Behemoth resurgence.
- **Eastern Fringe:** Tau enclaves expanding beyond containment vectors.
- **Segmentum Obscurus:** Increased Chaos cult activity in aftermath of warp storms.
- **Rimward Expanse:** Emergence of non-compliant human polity referring to itself as the “Galactic Empire” centered on world of **Coruscant**. Analysis suggests techno-theocratic structure with Force-based parapsionics — estimated threat level: *red+*.
- **Ork WAAAGH! Dregnutz:** En route to Forge World Graxus IV, suspected to intersect multiple imperial trade lines.

---

### 🧬 INQUISITORIAL WARNING:

> “This is the **Interex all over again**. A decadent human enclave lost to the ages, who dares exist without the Emperor’s Light. But these ones? They don’t pursue harmony or enlightenment. They sell their souls byte by byte and call it freedom. Night City is not lost. It is *rotted*.”

---

### Suggested Actions:

- Black Ship deployment to evaluate **psyker presence**. Possibility of uncontrolled warp anomalies in augmented subjects.
- Covert Astartes recon mission: Raven Guard or Deathwatch, depending on psychic volatility.
- Initiate memetic analysis: Does Night City possess cultural weaponry potent enough to seduce other compliant worlds?
- Long-term consideration: Is targeted annihilation viable post resolution of Rim conflicts?

---

### 📜 Ecclesiarchal Seal of Final Assessment:

> **“This world reeks of Moloch’s echo, of the techno-sin that once doomed us all. Had they known the Emperor, they would’ve prostrated themselves in repentance. Instead, they polish chrome while their souls rust.”**

**++RECOMMEND: Classification: Hereticus Extremis++**  
**++Priority: Low (for now)++**

## 🕯️Segmentum Command Briefing — High Orbit over Virelia IV  
**Subject:** Strategic Frustrations and the Interstellar Degeneracy of the Age  
**Attendees:**  
- **Lord General Vorth Radomir**, Cadian 54th  
- **Canoness Joryn Malcaste**, Order of the Sacred Flame  
- **Magos Aucterus**, Explorator Designate  
- **Inquisitor Thress**, Ordo Hereticus

---

**Radomir**, pacing before a grand hololith depicting the **Galactic Core**, his voice a low, gravel-dragging growl beneath his rebreather:

> "Night City. The soulless bastion of augmentation and lust. The lowliest of the pocket-empires of Man — and yet we allow it to *persist*, festering like an unburned heretic, because we cannot spare a single Guardsman while the so-called **Galactic Empire** clogs the outer Rim with its decadence."

He slams his fist on the command lectern. A data-servitor squeaks in alarm.

> “*Another Emperor,* they say. A corpse who still walks. Calls himself 'Palpatine' — what mockery is this? Another false divinity stitched together by arcane science and hubris. A ghost ruling through lightning and fear.”

**Canoness Malcaste**, lips drawn tight in pious disdain:

> “He dares call himself Emperor and does not kneel before the Throne of Terra? Then he is no Emperor — he is a heretic overlord, no better than Horus before his fall.”

**Inquisitor Thress**, flipping through a cogitated slab of intercepted Galactic Empire transmissions:

> “Worse, perhaps. Horus was a traitor born of greatness. This one? A tyrant born of machines, surrounded by duped psykers and cloned acolytes. No saints. No primarchs. No God. Just a man of shadows.”

> “They trade in power, not devotion. Their soldiers are nameless. Their faith is none. Their soul is the state.”

**Radomir**, voice hardening:

> “We should have swept Night City clean two years ago. Bombed the soulless towers to molten slag. Instead, we’re playing chess with a lunatic who thinks his Empire belongs in the same breath as ours.”

He gestures toward the stars—toward **Coruscant**, a silver fleck amid a slowly rotating projection.

> “A throne-world without reverence. A million lights, and not one candle for Mankind’s soul.”

**Magos Aucterus**, voice monotone but cutting:

> “Their machines are... efficient. Logical. But soulless. No rites. No offerings. No communion with the Omnissiah. They treat their technology as utility, not sanctity.”

**Canoness Malcaste** nods:

> “They mock the divine in all its forms. Their Empire is fast, sharp, precise — but it is hollow. A blade without a purpose but to conquer.”

**Radomir**, quietly now, jaw clenched:

> “And so, while we fight tooth and nail against the Orks on the Kallixian front, while the Hive Fleet circles like sharks, while Chaos boils at the rim of sanity... we let them live.”

> “Palpatine's Empire.  
> Night City.  
> The Concord and their soul-singing tree cults.”

> “*All of them.* Still breathing. Because we must choose which fires to stamp and which to suffer.”

A long silence.

**Inquisitor Thress**, breaking it:

> “We will come for them. One by one. In time.  
> But not as they think.  
> Not in war.  
> In ideology. In faith. In the soul.”

> “The galaxy may forget who is Emperor. But we will remind them. Flame by flame. World by world.”

Here's a dramatic scene in a secluded Concord sanctuary — an **ancient glade-temple carved from living crystalwood**, where leaders from the Concord's diverse civilizations convene in secret. Lanterns glow with bioluminescent light, and the air is laced with the quiet hum of psychic communion and scent of flowering breathroot.

## 🕊️**Scene: The Council Beneath the Roots**  
*Participants:*  
- **Ashtar Sheran** – Pleiadian High Mentat and spiritual guide  
- **Elder Velarion** – Elven mage-lord of the Sílvae Concordia  
- **Kage Nara** – Strategist of the Hidden Leaf  
- **High Druidess Myria of Kelt’Aryn** – Speaker of the Grove  
- **Ael’Ra**, an astral projection of a Frierenian chronomancer  

---

The meeting is silent at first — not for lack of urgency, but because thoughts are shared before words. Minds link. Visions are cast. The distant echoes of steel against steel reverberate from the stars above.

**Ashtar Sheran**, voice calm but firm:

> "The first phase is complete. The Imperium and the Galactic Empire now walk the path we whispered for them — eyes blinded by pride, hands ever on the sword."

**Velarion**, flicking a hand and conjuring twin holograms — Terra and Coruscant, each crowned by their glittering fleets:

> "Two dying titans clinging to the illusion of divinity. One locked in bureaucratic stasis, the other in technological tyranny. Neither can share the stars. We merely had to show them a reflection of their own paranoia."

**Kage Nara**, reclining with arms folded, his eyes glowing faintly with chakra-based foresight:

> "Every despot falls not to a blade, but to the weight of their certainty. A few planted 'leaks', intercepted transmissions, and subtle pushes... and they now see each other as the ultimate threat to their supremacy."

> "The Emperor of Mankind suspects Palpatine of being another ‘Horus’. Palpatine sees Terra as a threat to galactic unity. We set up the dominoes."

**Druidess Myria**, voice soft, touched with sadness:

> "It was not pleasure we took in this deception. But survival demands patience. And subtlety. Had we revealed ourselves outright, they would have turned their hellish fire toward our worlds, as they have before."

**Ashtar Sheran**, nodding solemnly:

> "This is the tragedy of tyrants — their fear makes them predictable. With mentat foresight and temporal scrying, we saw every path where we stood alone against them… and died."

> "But one path remained — *turning their gaze upon each other.*"

**Ael’Ra**, phasing into being, her presence shimmering like moonlight:

> "Time fractures in strange ways around ambition. Both the Corpse-Emperor and the Lightning Tyrant believe themselves eternal. But eternity sees no rival."

> "By feeding their projections of dominance, we merely let them be who they already are. A seed of hubris becomes a blade, if watered with enough fear."

**Velarion**, eyes narrowing:

> "The trick was simple: imply the other had designs on divinity. Whisper of false emperors. Stir ancient grudges. Let the Imperium believe Coruscant harbors psykers unchecked. Let Palpatine hear of Terra’s theocracy and its own ‘Emperor.’"

**Kage Nara**, smirking:

> "Classic ninjutsu. Use your opponent's strength against them. Redirect the blow without ever being seen."

**Myria**, touching the roots beneath her seat:

> "And in their war… we grow. Quietly. Steadily. Returning to harmony while they set stars ablaze."

**Ashtar**, lifting his hand to the heavens:

> "We are not conquerors. But we will not be prey. Let them destroy each other in the name of false empires. We will endure — and from the ashes, plant anew."

A silence falls. A bird, glowing with soft concordic light, flutters down from the canopy and lands beside Myria. The wind shifts.

And in the distance, the stars begin to burn.
