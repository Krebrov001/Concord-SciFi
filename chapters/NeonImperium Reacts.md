**[Internal Arasaka Memo – Encrypted, Level Gamma Clearance]**  
**TO:** Executive Council, Department of Narrative Containment  
**FROM:** M. Tanaka, Dir. of Digital Psych-Ops  
**SUBJECT:** Containment Protocol: “Velarion” Persona – Growing Ideological Contamination Risk

---

**SUMMARY:**  
The online persona known as **“Velarion, High Wizard of the Space Elves”**, allegedly a Concord emissary, has gained significant traction across Night City subnet forums, especially in nodes frequented by youth, netrunners, and disillusioned mid-tier employees. His spiritual rhetoric and depictions of Concord culture—especially on **love, intimacy, autonomy, and biosocial tech**—are fueling an alarming degree of ideological deviation from standard Corporate-Acceptable Values (CAVs).

**KEY POINTS OF CONCERN:**  
- Posts under Velarion's name are **consistently trending** on eco-druid, identity-hacker, and trauma-recovery subnet spaces.  
- Viral phrases like *“You don’t live in Night City, because you can’t call this life”* and *“They grow their future, we rent ours”* have breached into mainstream entertainment feeds.  
- First cross-dataset correlation between interest in Velarion’s teachings and **reduced neuro-spending behavior** detected. (Less consumption of neuro-ads, aug updates, stimulants.)  
- Quiet rise in **unauthorized, unscheduled augment removal surgeries** in black clinics. Probable ideological link.

**RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:**  

1. **Immediate Narrative Containment (Tier B):**  
   Deploy mocking counter-memes portraying Velarion as an elven cultist, stoner hippie, or offworld LARP grifter. Attach AI-generated deepfakes suggesting mental instability or past war crimes.

2. **Digital Footprint Scramble:**  
   Launch subtle disinformation campaigns to **cast doubt on the authenticity** of Velarion's Concord affiliation. Introduce contradictory personas claiming to be “the real Velarion.”

3. **Astroturf Psy-Debunking Campaign:**  
   Seed corporate-aligned influencers to host debates titled *“Why the Concord Would Collapse in Night City”* or *“Space Elves vs. Supply Chains: A Critical Breakdown.”*

4. **Targeted Disruption of Velarion Access Points:**  
   Geo-fence subnet entry nodes showing most Velarion activity. Redirect queries to corporate therapy bots or retail microdosing “relaxation” products.

5. **Prepare Emergency “Uplift Directive” Draft:**  
   In case containment fails and Concord influence spikes further, propose a pre-emptive **“Humanitarian Integration Package”** — essentially corporate rebranding of select Concord ideals to neutralize their revolutionary edge.

**[Leaked Memo Hits the Underground: Title—“They Want to Kill the Wizard”]**

In the dim corners of Night City's meshnet, the leaked Arasaka memo rippled like a sonic blast. The words *“Kill it now. Meme it to death.”* became the tagline of the hour, reshared across pirate forums, anonymous subnet threads, and encrypted eco-punk group chats. Reactions were immediate, furious, and illuminating.

**@rootkitSaint:**  
> Holy fragging hell… they’re *scared*.  
> A space elf talking about *love* and *trees* and they’re ready to unleash a full-blown memetic war. That says more about them than about him.

**@nek0net:**  
> “Geo-fence Velarion access points.”  
> Translation: censor anything that makes you feel again.  
> Translation: the corpos know that *soulfulness is contagious.*

**@dirtwave42:**  
> Lmao “wizard grifter”? Bro sounds like he’s offering more healing than any Arasaka therapistbot.  
> They want to slap a shopping cart on your soul, and Velarion just said “you are not your paycheck.”

**@CyberHermit:**  
> They admit it right here. “Reduced neuro-spending behavior.”  
> That’s the real heresy: people *not buying stuff*. Not wanting upgrades. Not treating love like a subscription plan.  
> The revolution won’t be televised, but it’ll be forest-grown.

**@SpiralRune (verified eco-mystic):**  
> I was skeptical of this Concord stuff until now. But when the masters panic… that’s when you know the prophets are real.  
> They want to kill the wizard because the wizard woke up the children.

**@an0maLyX:**  
> "Dump porn overlays on his vids if we have to."  
> *Exactly* what Velarion warned about: distortion of love, hypersexual distraction, numbing of desire.  
> This is psychological warfare in the name of profit.  
> F— this system.

**A new tag goes viral:**  
🌲#LetTheWizardSpeak 🌲  
It floods every corner of Night City’s darknet, scrawled in augmented graffiti tags, coded into netrunner glyphs, whispered over black-market comms.

And among the voices is **Velarion** himself, replying in serene syntax:

> “Do not let their fear turn your heart to anger. Let it turn it to clarity. They fear not me. They fear *you* remembering who you truly are.” 🌌

A meme follows:  
A massive Arasaka tower, surrounded by roots and vines, overgrown.

**@rootkitSaint:**  
The more they panic, the clearer it gets. They know this isn’t just some PR headache — it’s existential. Velarion and the Concord ideas are breaking their chains *in real time*. They want us to stay broken, dependent, distracted.

**@neonflux:**  
This whole “corpse starch” thing is hilarious but also tragic. Like, we’re all literally being fed industrial byproducts while they pretend to be gods. Meanwhile, Velarion’s talking about *living ships* and *soul bonds* — shit that’s literally alien tech for the heart and mind.

**@dyss3nt:**  
I can’t stop thinking about the line from the memo about “neuro-spending behavior.” Like, they *need* us addicted and buying nonstop. It’s capitalism’s brain parasite. If Velarion’s right, and love can actually *heal* us from this, then that’s why they’re terrified.

**@ghostlancer:**  
Been hearing whispers on the mesh about more netwar ops targeting anyone linked to Concord channels. Velarion’s being smeared as some cult leader, and yet, people *feel* something real when they listen.

**@silica_haze:**  
I downloaded some of the Concord vids—living bio-ships, psychic trees, warriors who fight with mind and spirit. It’s like sci-fi met shamanism, and honestly, it’s better than our neon hellscape.  
Makes me wonder: what if this isn’t just “woo-woo,” but a *real* alternative?

**@RogueNeuron:**  
The memes about “corpse starch breakfast” and “forest whisperers” aren’t just jokes anymore. They’re symbols of resistance. We’re tired of being disposable cogs in their machine.

**@bladerunner_88:**  
Wonder if Arasaka’s paranoia will backfire. Trying to suppress this just gives it fuel. The more they push the “witchcraft” narrative, the more curious people get. The cracks in their control show.

**@edenfall (eco-activist):**  
What if we could tap into these “psychic roots” Velarion speaks of? Not just for data but to rebuild connection? This city could use a *forest* in its heart, not just steel and neon.

**@blackicebreaker:**  
Skeptics beware — don’t fall for the fantasy. But I admit, even *I* feel the sting when I hear Velarion talk about the trauma of broken bonds. Maybe there’s a *truth* to be found beneath all this.

**@net_ghost:**  
One thing’s clear: the old systems are rotting. Imperium, Galactic Empire, Night City corps—they all fear what they can’t own or control. The Concord offers a glimpse of freedom.  
And yeah, it’s terrifying for them.

*Thread pinned with this quote from Velarion:*  
**“A soul unbound by chains is a forest unchained—roots deep, branches wide, reaching beyond their cages.”** 🌿

---

**The conversation hums on, as more netizens and nethackers dive deeper, searching for seeds of something new amidst the neon decay.**

---

The High Lords of Terra get notice of the "Velarion Memos" via an archive of the conversations transmitted via broad-frequency interstellar broadcasts coming from Night City. They have a discussion with the Inquisition and Eclessiarchy on this.

**High Lords of Terra Chamber, Palace of the Emperor — Session Transcript**

*The holographic table glows dimly with a flicker of archived transmissions intercepted from the Night City broadcast frequencies. The voices of Velarion and the underground netizens—filled with blasphemous notions of “soul bonds” and “living ships”—play faintly.*

**High Lord Castellan Marius Valcoran:**  
"This is... preposterous. The audacity of these heretics broadcasting sedition across the void. To speak openly of these xeno abominations, this ‘Velarion’—a self-styled wizard leading the enemy in the shadows. Such blasphemy cannot be tolerated."

**Inquisitor Lord Veridax:**  
"My Lords, these transmissions from Night City reveal a dangerous ideological contagion. The ‘Concord’ philosophies echo outright psionic heresy—witchcraft, sorcery, and subversion. Worse, they appeal directly to the vulnerable, sowing doubt in the Emperor’s light and promoting treasonous union with xenos and mutants."

**Cardinal Hieronymus Secundus (Ecclesiarchy):**  
"The Enemy whispers in corrupted tongues, twisting the faithful with honeyed lies. Their talk of ‘living ships’ and ‘psychic roots’ is but daemonic trickery, designed to ensnare souls and pull them from the True Path. The Emperor’s glory is absolute; their ‘paths of peace’ lead only to ruin."

**High Lord Treasurer Cassia Velora:**  
"These subversive broadcasts have the potential to destabilize entire systems under Imperial dominion. The corporate enclaves on Terra’s outer colonies could be infiltrated. Economic power is wielded by those who control the masses—if their minds become poisoned with such xeno philosophy, production falters, obedience crumbles."

**Inquisitor Lord Veridax:**  
"We must deploy agents of the Ordo Hereticus to infiltrate and excise this ‘Concord’ cultist network. Purge corrupted netnodes and silence their ‘Velarion’ emissaries. Psykers specialized in counter-psionics must be mobilized to root out the witchcraft."

**High Lord Castellan Marius Valcoran:**  
"Indeed. The Imperium’s survival depends on the eradication of this rot. Yet, we must consider the growing reach of the Concord, and the possible complicity or weakness of our own corporate factions in allowing this poison to spread."

**Cardinal Hieronymus Secundus:**  
"The Emperor’s wrath will descend. This ‘Concord’ is the serpent in our garden, a cancer to be purged by flame and faith. Let all hear: no compromise will be tolerated with heretics, xenos, or apostates."

**High Lord Treasurer Cassia Velora:**  
"Let us also review the corporate entanglements that enable such threats. The machine of commerce must be cleansed as thoroughly as the machine of war."

**High Lord Castellan Marius Valcoran:**  
"Prepare a full edict. The ‘Velarion Memos’ and all such transmissions shall be declared heretical propaganda. The Imperium will not suffer this blasphemy to fester within its realm."

*The chamber falls silent as the transmission fades, the gravity of the threat to the Imperium’s ideological and political dominion clear.*

---

**Summary:**  
The High Lords, Ecclesiarchy, and Inquisition convene urgently, deeming the "Velarion Memos" as dangerous heresy and psychological warfare aimed at destabilizing Imperial faith and control. Plans for infiltration, purges, and suppression of the Concord’s ideology begin, alongside scrutiny of corporate complicity on Terra and its colonies. The Imperium resolves to crush this threat swiftly and mercilessly.

---

**Imperium Propaganda Transmission**  
*Broadcast across Imperial frequencies, in a booming, solemn tone:*  

“Citizens of the Imperium of Man, hear the truth with unwavering faith and clarity!  
Beware the insidious lies of the so-called ‘Velarion Memos,’ heretical scribblings scribed by alien sympathizers and xeno-spawned deceivers. These blasphemous whispers seek to undermine the sacred unity of Mankind under the God-Emperor’s eternal light.  

The ‘Velarion’ is no wizard, but a charlatan—a dark puppet of the Concord, whose treacherous woods and witchcraft threaten the sanctity of the Machine and the glory of Holy Terra. Their ‘living ships’ are daemonic abominations, their ‘soul bonds’ are nothing but devilry designed to weaken the mind and soul of loyal citizens.  

Reject these vile lies! Reject the heresy that would rend the fabric of our divine order! The Imperium stands eternal—steel and faith unyielding! The Emperor’s wrath will crush all who dare defy His will.  

Ave Imperator! Ave Terra!”

**Night City Underground Forum: “The Neon Nexus”**  
*(Screens flash with comments as hackers and denizens gather around the intercepted transmission)*  

**“GhostByte”**:  
“Lol, the Imperium really can’t let go of their corpse starch paranoia, huh? ‘Soul bonds’ = devilry, ‘living ships’ = daemonic abominations. Sounds like someone’s scared of Mother Nature and connection.”  

**“NeuroLinx”**:  
“They’re trying to scare people into submission with their old-school thunder and lightning. The same old ‘reject the xeno, worship the machine’ spiel. Feels like propaganda from our own corpos sometimes.”  

**“RootRunner”**:  
“Anyone else notice how terrified they are of the Concord’s *living ships*? They’re scared because the Concord’s tech is *alive*—not some cold, dead steel obeying some glitchy AI. That’s the future they want to crush.”  

**“Pix3lGhost”**:  
“Interesting how they mention ‘soul bonds’ as devilry. Meanwhile, we live in a city where love’s been commodified, sold, and hacked to bits. Maybe the Imperium’s got a point about spiritual sickness—but maybe *they’re* the sickness.”  

**“EchoMind”**:  
“Bro, ‘Ave Imperator’ sounds like a curse, not a blessing. These guys want to keep us under chains, not free us. Velarion’s words about connection and respect? That’s what we need. Not more steel prisons and corpse starch.”  

**“GlitchHex”**:  
“Anyone got more on these ‘Velarion Memos’? The Imperium calls it heresy, but maybe it’s the antidote we’ve been waiting for. Neon towers vs. ancient trees. Which side are you on?”  

**“NeuroLinx”**:  
“Propaganda intercepted. Truth revealed. The war for the soul of Night City—and beyond—just got real.”  

*The conversation deepens, spreading across subnet channels, sparking debates, memes, and further leaks, as the Imperium’s attempt to silence the Concord ideology only fans the flames of rebellion.*

**Arasaka Corporate Boardroom – Executive Summit**

The cavernous room pulsed with the faint hum of servos and the glow of holo-screens displaying the intercepted Imperium propaganda transmission. Around the polished obsidian table sat the city’s top executives, each framed by the neon glow seeping through the panoramic windows. The air was thick with tension, blending corporate calculation with a simmering fear.

**CEO Nakamura:**  
“Let’s be clear. The Imperium’s propaganda isn’t just old-world religious fanaticism; it’s a calculated psychological assault against the Concord ideology gaining traction in our own city. Their ‘Velarion Memos’ have infiltrated the underlayers of our subnet. This is no fringe phenomenon—it threatens our entire socio-economic control framework.”

**Chief Security Officer Reyes:**  
“The memes, the leaks, the online chatter—it’s eroding loyalty to our systems. The Imperium’s broadcast acts like a double-edged sword: it discredits the Concord publicly, but paradoxically legitimizes their existence by acknowledging the threat. We cannot allow this to escalate.”

**Head of Media Ops, Li Wei:**  
“Our analysts confirm that the narrative of ‘heretical alien sympathizers’ resonates with the core corporate loyalists, but among the wider population, it’s feeding disillusionment. The Elder’s ‘living ships’ and ‘soul bonds’ concepts have been twisted into a symbol of organic resistance to our technological dominion. It’s... dangerous.”

**CFO Delgado:**  
“From a shareholder perspective, the erosion of consumer dependency—on augmentations, on synthetics, on our controlled media—is a direct hit to profits. If people start valuing ‘natural connection’ over cybernetic enhancement and relentless productivity, our entire market collapses.”

**VP of R&D, Dr. Marquez:**  
“They call the Concord’s tech ‘daemonic abominations’—it’s a desperate attempt to frame bio-tech as unclean and subversive. Our labs are pushing new neural implants and data-streaming tech precisely to counter that narrative, to bind users more tightly to our network. But the cultural pull of ‘living’ and ‘psychic’ tech is strong. We’re losing the hearts as well as the minds.”

**CEO Nakamura:**  
“We must launch a coordinated counter-memetic campaign. Amplify the Imperium’s propaganda *and* our own—portraying the Concord as naïve, regressive fools who reject progress. Flood the net with sanitized images of the Imperium’s ‘holy steel,’ ‘order,’ and ‘divine destiny’—make it aspirational, irresistible.”

**Head of Cyber Ops, Kuroda:**  
“We can infiltrate the subnets with tailored misinformation. Frame Velarion as a deluded cult leader, undermine his credibility. At the same time, plant stories of ‘Concord failures’—starvation, internal dissent, mysticism gone wrong. Play on Night City’s innate distrust of ‘tree-huggers’ and ‘hippie-tech.’”

**Chief Legal Officer Bennett:**  
“Also initiate heavy censorship protocols under the guise of ‘public security’ and ‘anti-terrorism.’ Flag and suppress Velarion-related content, while creating corporate-sponsored ‘alternative philosophy’ influencers to drown out dissident voices.”

**CEO Nakamura:**  
“This isn’t just about controlling a narrative—it’s about survival. The Concord threatens the entire ecosystem we’ve built here. If their ideals spread, we lose control of the people, the resources, the future. Remember: *We* built Night City’s neon towers. The Imperium’s propaganda only highlights how fragile their ‘divine order’ is. Our order depends on *corporate dominion*, and we will defend it.”

**VP Marquez:**  
“Prepare immediate rollout. Sleepless nights ahead.”  

The executives exchanged grim nods, each aware that the war for hearts and minds in Night City had just become far more complex—and perilous—than any of them had anticipated.

**Night City Underground Forum – /cyberspace/revolt/**

**[Anonymous_Hacker42]:**  
> Just got my hands on a juicy leak from Arasaka’s latest board meeting. Apparently, the corpos are freaking out about the “Velarion Memos” and the whole Concord vibe spreading in the shadows. They call it a threat to their “corporate dominion” and admit the propaganda they’re blasting is a double-edged sword.  
>  
> Guess what? The “NeonImperium” ain’t just a meme anymore. It’s a full-blown corporate-ecclesiarchy hybrid nightmare. Arasaka knows that if people start buying into the Concord’s way—living ships, soul bonds, psychic nets—they lose the chains that keep us all enslaved.

**[EcoPunk_Rose]:**  
> “NeonImperium,” hell yeah. That’s exactly what this is. Glorified corporate overlords preaching obedience through neon-lit lies and synthetic addictions. Night City’s just a techno-serfdom in a glowing cage.  
>  
> And “corpsestarch”? Damn, that hit me. Processed synthetic junk we call food, chemical fodder pumped into our veins while they preach ‘progress’ and ‘efficiency’. Makes the Imperium’s corpse worship seem almost poetic.

**[SynthSeer]:**  
> The leaked memo confirms what we all suspected: the corpos *fear* what can’t be owned or hacked—true living connection. Their “holy steel” and “machine spirit” propaganda is just desperate noise to drown out the roots growing beneath their towers.  
>  
> Velarion and the Concord? They’re the real revolutionaries. While we’re stuck with neon and steel, they’ve got psychic forests and ships that *listen* to their pilots. Imagine what that means for freedom from corporate chains.

**[NeonDissident]:**  
> Just heard a rumor the corpos plan to flood our feeds with more “Imperial” propaganda and purge any “heretical” content. Time to double down on decentralized hosting and peer-to-peer truth-sharing. They want control? Let’s give them *anarchy.*

**[DataGhost]:**  
> Anyone else notice how the Imperium’s fear of “witchcraft” and “xeno influence” mirrors how the corpos freak out about anything organic or uncorporate? It’s like two sides of the same coin—fear of losing control over their subjects.

**[SilentSapling]:**  
> It’s wild to think how a message from distant stars about soul-bonds and living trees shakes this concrete jungle to its core. The leak proves one thing: *we’re not alone in wanting something better*.

> The question is—will we rise, or stay shackled beneath their neon lights?

**[Anonymous_Hacker42]:**  
> Time to make noise. Share this leak. Spread the memes. The Concord’s roots are already deep in the dark web. Let’s water them with rebellion. #NeonImperium #CorpseStarch #LivingResistance

The digital streets buzzed as the underground net bristled with renewed energy—hope and rebellion sprouting amid the neon glow and concrete shadows.
