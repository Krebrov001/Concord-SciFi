### Velarion's notes:

**Strategic Implication for the Concord**
- **Wars become rare**: Only Borg, Reapers, and Flood are automatically in the “to be destroyed” category. The civilizations the Concord eliminates (Borg, Reapers, Tyranids, Flood) share two traits: **existential threat + soul-death philosophy**.
- **Meta-strategy**: Concord becomes known not as a conqueror, but as the *civilizational hospice and healer* for fallen or misguided empires.

**The Borg**
- **Baseline temperament**: Relentless assimilation of all life into machine hive-mind; pure embodiment of soul-death.
- **Concord diplomatic prospects**: Zero. The Borg are memetic and biological entropy engines.
- **Outcome**: Declared existential enemy; would be targeted for complete destruction with Vimanas, astral strikes, and bioship quarantines.
- **Verdict**: Irreconcilable. No peace possible.
- **Weakness**: They rely on central processing nodes and collective AI coordination. They also require time to adapt to new threats.
- **Concord Method**:  
  1. **Astral Recon** – Concord telepaths can project directly into Borg vessels or Unicomplex nodes to map their entire internal architecture before firing a shot.  
  2. **Ki-Bioship Strike** – Saiyan ki channeled through a bioship’s resonance core or an Ancient Vimanas’ crystalline focusing array would generate an *instantaneous, adaptive-shield-bypassing energy burst*.  
  3. **One-Shot Erasure** – A single coordinated volley from multiple bioships could vaporize an entire Unicomplex before the Borg adapt.  
  4. **Residual Cleanse** – Memory Trees could be planted on liberated worlds to heal residual psychic damage from assimilation.

**The Borg**
- **Logistical overhead:** Minimal – supply-chains nonexistent, instantenaenous dimensional folds and surgical decapitation strikes.
- **Elimination time required:** ~2–4 hours
- **Methods taken:** Targeted Astral Hack of Collective + bioship/Vimana ki-barrage on central nodes | Ki blasts disrupt quantum core synchrony.

### The battle

Before the battle, the Pleiadian mentats all performed a ritual, putting their hands on a cluster of memory-trees, feeding their memories into the Deepwood pulse. This allowed them to map their mental models of the coordinates and locations of Borg bases and ships into the Deepwood pulse. The living bioships sent their roots into the forest, picking up these signals traveling among the roots. Once they have absorbed the memories containing the locations of the coordinates, they were good to go.

Saiyan warriors, led by Goku and Vegeta went into the bioships. Thousands of bioships took off simultaneously from Concord worlds. Then in a blink of an eye, they vanished, each one of them dimensionally folding into point blank range on top of a designated Borg cube or Borg-controlled planet.

‘Battle’ of Delta Orionis Sector, Stardate 77451.6. Seven Borg cubes detected near a transwarp conduit. A Concord task group of four Saiyan bioships folded in at point-blank range. Each vessel discharged a concentrated ki beam—planetary-grade output. All seven cubes were vaporized within 0.8 seconds. The Concord ships then folded out. No debris, no pursuit."

The Saiyan bioship especially, with their dimensional folding capabilites, can teleport to anywhere in the galaxy, and potentially into other galaxies as well. The Saiyan's natural ki abilities, greatly enhanced through rigorous training, and amplified by the bioships' ki-transmission abilities, make the Saiyan bioships into portal weapons of planetary destruciton.

Concord has already used this to wipe out perceived by them vectors of soul-death such as the Borg which the Federation could not destroy. A notable incident the Saiyan bioships dimensionally folded into space within point-blank range of the Borg cubes, each one firing a powerful ki beam that completely incinerated the Borg cubes, and then promptly dimensionally folding away.

This pattern was repeated thousands of times within a matter of mere hours, thousands of Borg bases were eliminated for good.

In one Borg engagement, multiple cubes simply… went dark. No explosions, no debris—only derelicts adrift, their crews absent.

**Borg Sphere Delta-34**, disintegrating in a silent, white bloom. Sensor logs showed no warp signatures, no detectable weapons discharge—only a resonance spike that preceded total systems collapse.

This all seems to suggest that the Concord's force-projection capabilites are much greater than their otherwise Bronze-Age, autarkic, Buddhist-Mormon lifestyle seems to suggest. And also their willingness to eliminate percieved "soul-death vectors" from the galaxy with surgical precision and no declarations of war.
