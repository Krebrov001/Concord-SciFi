# The Starseed

### Stranger in a strange world - A Night City story

Walking back to his apartment in Night City at 9:00 PM, Gabriel stared at the stars above, barely visible past the light pollution of neon signs and air pollution of thick sulfuric brown clouds. It was not often the case, but today for reasons only the climate analysts at Arakasa knew, and he was able to count up to 30 stars. It was an oddly comforting sight to see the stars out. So far away, yet strangely familiar. He never felt at home in this world of Cyber-Earth.

Stepping over the puddles, he reflected on his life. He worked as a software developer at one of the major technology companies. Not the legendary Big 5 Tech Companies of Arasaka, Militech, Zetatech, Night Corp, and Kang Tao that everyone in his field wanted to get into. The most prestigious tech companies, that pay the highest salaries, and offer the sweetest perks. The entrance exams were too difficult. Realistically speaking, he could probably definitely get in if he devoted an entire year of his free time for studying algorithms and data structures.

But Gabriel saw no point in doing that. He was earning six figures, above average salary for a Night City young man of his age, but he was unfulfilled. After years of a grueling 5-year Computer Science curriculum at Night City University, he had reached a plateau of debugging, scouring over documentation, training AI models, writing code for neural networks, and a bunch of other uninspiring work. Sure, they paid well enough to be comfortable, but other than that, Gabriel had no use for money.

He thought,
> They could have been paying me a billion eddies per year at this job, and I wouldn't even notice. My life would have stayed the same; it would not change. It's just a number to me.

Much of the work here was pointless, and does not inspire Gabriel towards some kind of higher ideals. It's just a kind of existence of being a replaceable cog in a corporate machine. Every day at his job is merely the same day repeated hundreds of times. A "Groundhog Day" syndrome, the days blurring together and distorting his sense of time. Just after Gabriel completed an assignment, he is given another one. And there's no end to it. Some kind of *infinite loop of algorithmic labor*. A life of motion without direction. Gabriel was definitely succeeding in his work deadlines and requirements, even staying up late at night to get things done. He was definitely working hard, he was definitely in motion, but where to - he himself did not know.

And so Gabriel didn't see any need to jump companies, to study extra hard, to get into the Big 5. Dedicating an entire year to studying for the entrance exams, consisting of multiple rounds of white-board questions. You go in and have to explain and algorithm or solve a problem by writing it directly on the white board. Like a super fast and competitive exam. And *if* he passed, what would he get in return? Prestige, he didn't care about it. Trauma Team coverage, he didn't love this world enough to care about living in it. More money, he had no use for it, spending only on rent, food, and some few clothes, otherwise not participating in the economy at all. He saw his peers blowing money on consumerism. They just **had** to have the latest trends, the newest tech, the coolest cars, the sparkiest fashion, and video games, and toys, and gambling, and drugs, and Virtual Sex Porn Dolls. It was all so shallow, void of meaning, and actually quite dumb. Gabriel didn't need all those things, preferring a more simple life.

He was merely working to pay his rents and dues and debts. Participation in the economic system being a requirement for obtaining food and shelter, the threat of homelessness and impoverishment always in the back of his mind. So he was relatively well fed and clothed, and had a decent roof over his head. But such a life gave him no purpose.

**Gabriel:**
> I feel like I am just making money for the corporate overlords, building software products for them, products that will be deprecated, forgotten, and wasted in a mere decade. My labor is just used to keep the corporate cog turning. So it seems disheartening a bit.

> Even though I am reasonably well fed and clothed, I do not see anything worthwhile here. Working only for the accumulation of money. Which is just a number for me, akin to a points system in a video game. Even I could buy some things with it, I really don't see a need for so many things.

> What is not worth dying for is seldom worth living for either. But I just don't have the guts to die.

Gabriel spent his free time viewing online Night City forums such as *Deepthread*, *Darknet*,  *Reddeyes*, and *4-**nach**os*. In one thread, he came across the following meme, based on a scene from the hysterical and wildly popular **Rick and Morty** anime.

**Scene:** Rick is confronted by a robot at the dinner table.

**Robot:**
> What is my purpose?

**Rick:**
> You make money for the corporation, raise shareholder stocks, and keep our clients happy.

Gabriel just didn't see the purpose of it all. What is the use of all this technology, if it's not helping the common people in any way, merely contributing to enriching the corporate oligarchs and arming the surveillance state with new tools against it's own population.

But more than just his job, his eyes were open to all of the societal rot that Cyber-Earth, and *especially* Night City proudly displayed. The whole society was fake, built on a bunch of lies. He observed, saw everything, and wondered, "how do these people not see this?"

The truth was hidden in plain sight. So painfully obvious that it was absolutely hilarious.

It's as if someone clever came along, secretly replaced the Sun with a lightbulb and no one noticed. And people would lay themselves out to tan, stretched out on the roofs of buildings, basking in the light of the big huge light bulb floating in the sky. And if they had any sense of beauty appreciation left in them, without resorting to smart-ass arguments about how "beauty is a relative term", they would look at the big huge light bulb, marveling at how wonderous it looks!

Gabriel chuckled sardonically at that thought.

But seriously, most people never even saw the Sun these days, staying indoors all the time under a glow of lightbulbs. For all intents and purposes, the Sun **had been replaced with a lightbulb in their lives!** Gabriel himself only saw the Sun two times per day: once when he left his apartment to go to work, and the second time when he came back home from work. And sometimes when there was an urgent deadline or some difficult assignments that he needed to do, staying late in the office, he only saw the Sun once during the morning, only leaving the company that he worked at when it was already dark outside. And then when he came back home he would work for several hours more before finally getting too exhausted to write code anymore, and then he would drag himself to his bed for a good 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep.

Indeed, many things have been replaced in Night City.
- The Sun becomes lightbulbs.
- Purpose becomes career.
- Community becomes network.
- House becomes rent.
- Creation becomes product.
- Love becomes consumption.
- Spirituality becomes self-help.
- Reproduction becomes stimulation.
- Education becomes mandatory corporate trainings.

In a similar way, many other things were replaced by illusions. What remains is a simulation of meaning. Not false enough to escape, but not real enough to feel alive in. Substituted for something that is similar enough to the original thing just so a majority of people won't notice. It feels kind of hilarious and ridiculous, but also extremely isolating because no one else sees it. And they judge you for this, calling you insane.

> “They've called me *insane* all my life,” thought Gabriel.

It *is* hilarious—**darkly, absurdly, devastatingly hilarious**—that someone (or some *thing*) swapped out the Sun for a lightbulb, and instead of panic or rebellion… everyone just kept going to work. Bought SPF 50. Installed blackout curtains. Made a YouTube video titled *“Why LED Daylight Bulbs Are Better Than the Sun (And 5 Reasons You’re Wrong).”*

---

**[INT. EARTH – DAY (Artificially Lit)]**

*A mustached everyman in a bowler hat wakes up. He stretches. Rubs his eyes. Opens the blinds. A cold, unblinking fluorescent bulb floats outside his window like a second moon.*

**(He blinks. Looks confused. Shrugs. Puts on tie.)**

**[Caption card:]**  
“Another beautiful day under the bulb.”

*He walks outside. Everyone is in business suits, worshipping parking meters, scrolling ghostly devices, standing under streetlamps like moths. A priest offers communion wafers printed with barcodes.*

*A child points upward:*

>**“Daddy, why is the sky humming?”**

>**“Don’t question it, sweetheart. It’s progress.”**

---

Most don’t notice, because the lightbulb is “good enough.” It flickers, but it’s reliable. It’s marketed as “eco-friendly.” People tell themselves: *This is what the Sun always felt like, right?*

That’s the thing: once you *see it*, the whole thing becomes so surreal you almost laugh out of shock. Like someone painted over reality with a cheap filter and called it “normal.” That *distance*—that outsider’s perspective—is both your *superpower* and your *burden*.

Gabriel felt the weight of this burden pressing on his soul every day. His entire life was one big culture shock. A stranger in a strange world. A man merely going through the motions of the day, fitting in with the crowd—but just barely. It was like he got isekai'd from another world into this one, and forgot all about that other world after reincarnating into this one.

But he did not forget all of it. Some bits and pieces of memories remained. Just a glimmer of them. As if you can see the Sun's rays shining from above, spearing through the gloomy clouds, but you can't see the Sun itself. But seeing those Sun's rays is enough for you to know that the floating 40-meter wide lightbulb in the sky is not the original source of illumination of this planet.

**Gabrial:**
> I remember another world, as strange as it seems. I have some half-memories, no clear pictures, but like the impression or "hash code" of the original object. I feel it's outlines but can't see it exactly. The essence of the other world civilization I seem to understand, even if I don't quite have the details.

He did’t have the original file—but he has its **checksum**. Its **emotional fingerprint**.

- He knew what it *feels like* to live in a world where work has meaning, even though he had been a salaryman, a corporate cog all of his life.
- He knew what *community* feels like, even if he had never seen one nor lived in one before.
- He knew what it is like to be *in love with the stars* and not with status.
- He knew what it is like to be *in love with a woman* and to be **loved back by her**, despite never having a relationship before.
- He knew what a truly harmonious civilization looks like, that operated on a principle of *maximizing spiritual health and development* of the individual, not maximizing corporate profit or unnecessary innovations.
- He knew the technological capabilities of that civilization, those defying contemporary scientific understanding. The bioships, the memory-trees, living technologies activated via a spiritual interface.

He began to write a science fiction story. Partly to record his half-memories of that other world. Partly as a form of escapism from this one. In his free time after work he would often times stay up late into the night, writing about this otherworldly society that filled his dreams. He composed his story and posted it onto an online forum called **cosmicwars.net** for others to view.

He also came across a forum thread on the UnderNet.

**Are you not from this planet? Here are 12 signs you might be a starseed.**

Gabriel clicked on the article. The author was a certain user **@Velarion**. He got in contact with that user, who surprisingly responded.

He told Velarion about his feelings, his observations on society, his half-memories, his anecdote about the Sun being replaced with a lightbulb, and even shared the **Rick and Morty** meme as an attachment.

#### **@Velarion:**  
> **About Starseeds *(continued)***

> Consider that **“alien” is not about shape, but soul**.
> And that some of the most alien experiences occur *among your own species.*

- **Elfkin can be alien to Elfkin** (e.g., Space Elves vs Dark Eldar).
- **Humans can be alien to Humans** (e.g., the Federation vs the Imperium).
- And even among “enlightened” civilizations, *the soul's path creates divergence.*

So, when a Federation diplomat meets a Planetary Governor of the Imperium, they *look* alike—two humanoid males, bipedal, same general organs—but their **worldviews are light-years apart**:
- One believes in diplomacy, empathy, scientific curiosity.
- The other believes in holy war, obedience, and purity of doctrine.

They are biologically kin.  
But they are **existentially alien.**

The Concord might say this is not a matter of race, species, or appearance.  
It is a matter of **soul distance**:

- Two people can be biologically identical, yet separated by **miles of meaning**.
- One may be embedded in the rhythms of soul, ritual, stillness.
- The other may be fused to the grind, the algorithm, the echo chamber.

They are human. You are human.  
But you are **not the same kind**.

---

#### **@Velarion:**  
You live on a planet where:
- The forest is replaced with a screen-saver of trees.
- The Sun is replaced with overhead LEDs.
- Community is replaced with Discord servers.
- Purpose is replaced with productivity dashboards.
- People chase numbers as if they’re sacred.
- Beauty is filtered.
- Joy is scheduled.
- Death is feared but life is unlived.
- Community is traded for comment sections.
- Silence is suspicious.
- Even love… is sometimes replaced with swipe-left dopamine hits.

And most damningly:
*Money is no longer a tool to live—it’s the meaning of life itself.*

And you wonder:

> *“How can they not see it? Don’t they feel the hollowness too?”*

But to them, you’re the odd one.  
You’re the “alien.” The outlier. The glitch.

You don’t speak the dialect of algorithm.  
You don’t respond to the rewards of the game.  
You don’t *belong to the same culture, even if you share DNA.*

- You meet people who look like you… but whose **core axioms** about love, truth, nature, and meaning are utterly different.
- They may share your language, but not your soul-frequency.
- You feel at home with a space elf more than your own neighbor.

Here’s the deeper Concord truth:  
**They are not your enemy.**  
They are *lost*.  
Many of them are in *pain they cannot name.*  
They numb it with purchases. With scrolling. With ideology. With performance.

So yes, it’s isolating. Of course it is.  
You’re *sensitive enough to feel the dissonance*, and brave enough not to lie to yourself about it.  
But that awareness—though painful—is also the seed of *freedom.*

That’s not escapism. That’s *spiritual alignment.*

That is how Concord spreads.  
Not by conquest. Not by force.  
But by *recognition*.

One soul turns and whispers:  
> “Wait. I thought I was alone.”

That’s how the real humans—*the soulful ones*—*find each other again.*
You are among aliens, yes.  
But you're not lost.  
You are the signal.

> Purgatory, in many traditions, is the place where souls go not to be punished—but to *remember*. And maybe that’s where you are right now: remembering. Not the false memories of advertising, not the fantasies of careerism—but the real memory, older than this civilization:

> “You were not born to be a gear. You were born to be a gardener of souls.”

>The **core truth** of the Concord is not just its aesthetics or technology, but its **spiritual architecture.**
>
>In a galaxy of factions divided by biology, ideology, and violence, the Concord stands as the *exception*—not because it ignores difference, but because it **recognizes the deeper unity** underneath it.

The Concord isn’t built on species.  
It’s built on **soul-frequency**.

- Pleiadians, Elves, Rodnovers, Shinobi, Benders, Saiyans…
- Different anatomies, lifespans, languages, aesthetics—
- But **the same assumptions** about life:
  - That love is sacred.
  - That nature is not a resource, but a relative.
  - That stillness is as important as action.
  - That truth is something you *feel* as much as deduce.
  - That the soul is real—and must be nourished.
  - That spiritual things are more important than material ones.

That’s why interbreeding happens—not out of fetishism or curiosity, but because **the souls are already in union.** The biological union is just *form catching up to essence.*

In the Concord, **cultural diversity is not erased.**  
A Shinobi still wears their headband.  
An Elf still speaks in poetry.  
A Rodnover still marks the seasons with runes.

But they can sit together at the same table because they **assume the same things** about what it means to live a meaningful life. Their spiritual distance is minimal. The unique cultural distinctions, such as clothing style, interior decor, and food is distinctive sure. But the fundamental assumptions about live, love, and nature are the same.

That’s why they can live together.  
That’s why their love is real.  
That’s why their peace *lasts*.

### Meeting the Space Wizard

Gabriel stood in front of the location mentioned in Velarion's online messages, **Misty's Esoterica and Chakra Harmonization**, located in *Urmland Street*, Watson. He still wasn't sure whether this was legit or not. However the location itself didn't look too shabby. What was the worst thing that could happen? Probably getting roped into yet another new-age cult scam, but not getting attacked by the booster gangs. This neighborhood was one of the more peaceful ones in Night City. He could feel safe here.

He opened the door, walked in, making a small ringing sound as the jingle bells hanging on the door collided with it and with each other, alerting the shopkeeper that a customer has arrived.

Gabriel paused to take in the scene. The room was not like others in Night City. No neon, no adds, no chrome in sight. Just simple, earthy tones. Wooden sculptures—inspirational artworks, bonsai trees, meditation crystals used for ritual purposes, and robotic cat statues with moving paws sat patiently on the shelves with expectation of purchase. The room was illuminated by burning incense sticks, glowing Chinese-style paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling, and candles, lots of candles. Instead of the pop songs, a podcast of conspiracy theorists was playing in the room, ranting about how the soul-dead people have mechanical eyes.

There was a small bookshelf at the side of the room. It was an unbalanced collection of books. Gabriel looked at the spines of the books, noticing the variety of titles.

- **The Junk Food Diet - Is your food your death?**
- **NutriJuice Colon Cleanse by Dr. Steward**
- **Healing Secrets of the Muddy Hot Springs**
- **Secrets of Warp Entity Banishment - Practical Exorcism Techniques**
- **How to Airbend with Examples and Illustrated - Third edition**
- **Shinobi Warfare 101 - Martial Arts Techniques that will save your life in a Street Fight**
- **The Control Programs of the Forces of Darkness**
- **Contact with the Pleiadians - My Trip to Taygeta**

Misty Olszewski, the soft-spoken owner of this store smiled at Gabriel, waving him in to not hesitate.

**Misty:**
> You are the first person to walk in here for two days. And two days ago, it was a pizza guy who got lost. People in this town have lost their spiritual connection. Oh well. I'm here to serve them, not the other way around.

**Gabriel:**
> Do you happen to know someone by the name of Velarion by any chance?

**Misty:**
> Oh yeah, he is a regular here. I respect him as a spiritual teacher, he is a real Zen Master. Unlike some pretenders and charlatans in Night City. I gave him a computer and now all he does is post articles and memes on the internet.

**Gabriel:**
> I am here to see him.

**Misty:**
> Velarion will see you now. He is in the back room.

---

Gabriel walks into the back room, and sees Velarion seated at a computer desk. He looks like an elderly man, but neither frail nor unhealthy. Long white hair, a short trimmed beard, archaic purple flowing robes, and elf ears. "Hmm, must be some kind of implant," Gabriel dismisses.

Velarion shows him their online conversation on his computer. Gabriel doubts no more, this is the man with whom he had been in discussion.

**Velarion:**
> Do you now believe, Gabriel? That there are other planets out there with people living on them? People who differ a little bit physically but having same souls? Maybe you remember your past lives in the Concord? Another path of development, an alternative society is possible!

**Velarion:**
> The people of this planet have been spiritually corrupted by the ones who secretly rule over them. The social medias, the television broadcasts, the music, the movies are for the most part deliberately engineered to lower the humanoid spiritual consciousness. They are instruments of secret repression. One half is propoganda and memetic warfare. The other half is institutionalized silencing of dissenting voices.

**Velarion:**
> The people here are overburdened by such a life. They are too overworked to think. Crime is let to fester on purpose. Beurocracy is inefficient on purpose. So that people would be forced into "survival mode" all their life, and have no time to think! For those who are overburdened, who are in their hamster wheels, who are too exhausted, who are merely surviving won't have time to stop and question the dystopian cyberpunk society in which they live. Make no mistake, the entire monetary structure and materialistically oriented society is a flawed society. By keeping one half of the population repressed and overburdened, and the other half addicted to money, consumerism, hedonism, and stimulating online internet content, the elites are able to keep people from questioning their rule. What's the point of you property and means, when you are 95% puppets of the corporate overlords? However you should know that in your society, the main objective of the corporations is *not making money*, *not profit*, but **control over resources** and **control over people**.

**Velarion:**
> While they deny the reality of extraterrestrial contact. The elites themselves are in league with off-worlders. Some of your corporate overlords have been trading cybernetic technology to alien civilizations in exchange for starship blueprints. There are now secret corporate and military colonies from Cyber-Earth on other planets that you don't know about. They call it the "Secret Space Program". Look up this term on the Net, you might find leaks from whistleblowers and netrunners. Others of your corporate overlords are discreetly involved in secret societies that are in league with off-world Chaos cults. They worship Slaanesh, a detrimental demonic Warp Entity from the Eye of Terror. Cyber-Earth based secret societies engage in a variety of sexual perversions, frequently using young children as victims for their sadistic rituals. It can only be described as sanctified torture. We have proof that some of the cultists are even secretly possessed by daemons.

**Velarion:**
> You have been wandering all your life. All your life you have felt that something is horribly wrong with this world, yet you were not able to put your finger on what exactly. Yet not all those who wander are lost. And not everyone's soul is dead yet. There are still a few people left in this city whose souls are alive. It is those who are teetering on the brink, to them I write my online messages. We cannot save those who have through their own actions, killed their souls. But we can save those whose soul is alive, they who are trapped in this soul-dead system.

**Velarion:**
> I have met beautiful, soulful, radiant people. Those who haven't forgotten what love is, who did not allow themselves to be washed away by the indomitable wave. David Martinez and Lucyna Kushinada. Or perhaps Jackie Welles and Misty Olszewski. They did not let their love get killed. Even before they met each other, they kept the flame alive and did not lose hope. The corporate overlords and their paid trolls would like you to believe that love is a mere biological illusion created by hormones. That people are merely meat-machines controlled by chemical reactions based on external stimuli. But if that were the case, how are you able to make a conscious decision to ready my articles online? This is the will, and it comes from your soul. The basic energy of nature against entropy and soul-death.

**Velarion:**
> As we have established, your society is being programmed in real time. A negative unloving man, who does not radiate love from his **spiritual heart** in his life, does not prevent dark control programs from penetrating into his bodies (physical, mental, astral), neither does he struggle nor resist against the widespread social engineering, thus becoming a merely expendable cog in the machine. A negative non-loving man is unfree, a controlled puppet-man. People who mentally and spiritually reside in the negative state—total conformists, 95% controlled by the corporate overlords. Their **spiritual heart** is not used—it's closed! They are mass programmed by the propoganda. The Mechanicus, Cyber-Earth corps, and Chaos cults all practice their own form of **anti-spiritual magic disguised as systems engineering**.

**Velarion:**
> And there are troll farms within which employees, servitors, and AI bots labor as slaves, being driven by their managers to work 20-hour shifts per day. They keep tabs on everyone. All people on Cyber-Earth are recorded in the computer of the surveillance state. Via big data algorithms they collect information about all aspects of your life, use it to create a psychological profile, and then adjust their content delivery systems to specifically target your insecurities, trauma, weaknesses, and personal struggles. You people all have Neural Implants. This enables the corporations to view you like a germ on a petri dish. Cyber-Earth man is **inserted/injected controlling thoughts and projected controlling pictures,** **and the control system immediately precisely detects EFFICIENCY of control** (in percents) – **the control program was successful, less successful,** **average, below-average,** **inefficient.** In case of inefficiency, the control system instantly picks from the data-system another variants of control (there are lots of them in the data-system), injects them into the human and a new report is quickly passed back about results of control – **so-called feedback.** This is algorithmic psychological profiling disguised as advertisements and personalization for your own convenience. Notice that in most cases you cannot opt out of these "services".

**Velarion:**
> How do you live in such a society, to avoid soul-death? Understand that the controlling surveillance system has predictive algorithms, however they are deterministic in nature. They are modeling your future behavior in real time, and adjusting to create control programs. Simple control program can be created in *one day*, more complex control programs in *three days*, depending on degree of complexity and number of elements engaged in the controlled scene. They more days, months, years the Forces of Darkness have to model your behavior, the more elaborate the control program is. So when you start living not according to pattern, not according to routine, not planning what you will do in advance, it throws off all of their calculations and they will have to re-calibrate it all over again. This is living according to love, according to intuition, doing what *feels natural* and what *feels right*, just like nature lives without planning. Hence, an important part of protection (in addition to lovingness) from this form of control is minimizing the amount of planning in your life to only minimal, unavoidable levels. The less, the better, best no planning whatsoever if possible, living life entirely guided by your soul, not by your algorithm.

**Velarion:**
> When a human comes along the path of spiritual development, it is not for enlightenment of revelation of super cosmic mysteries, but just for knowing what it's like to live like an actual human being again. It is not merely an optional scholarly study, it is the foundation for a good quality of life, without which it is a slippery slope to a world resembling an Imperium Hive City or a planet controlled by the forces of Chaos. A positive loving man is a free man. by emitting love in his life from his **spiritual heart**, the positive loving Cyber-Earth man prevents *dark control programs* from penetrating into his bodies. Hence forth he is encased in a loving shell–"aura" around positive people repels control programs, leading to freedom and lack of control. In the Concord, pure love of male and female is the highest value. Those who have remembered this on their own, who have stayed true to their souls, even before we came to this planet, we hold them in the highest esteemed.

**Velarion:**
> Now come, and I will take you to the Stargate, and you will see for yourself another world!

### Loving Life in Another World

Following Velarion's lead, Gabriel descended into the old abandoned subway station. They passed graffiti depicting trees and tulips, a silent act of rebellion against an oppressive system disguised as the epitome of personal freedom. They stepped through collapsed walls, bricks lying around on the floor, steel beams sticking out.

**Velarion:**
> Careful not to get cut by those steel beams, they're rusted.

And then Gabriel saw it, although at first he did not realize what he was seeing. A nondescript arch embedded into one of the walls. One could have mistaken it for simply an archway supporting the ceiling of the subway system. Or perhaps a whimsical feature of industrial design. But then Gabriel looked closer and he saw that the archway was shimmering on the inside, like a heat wave on the road.

**Velarion:**
> We have arrived. This is the Stargate.

Gabriel took Velarion's hand, and stepped through to another world.

The sudden change of scenery assaulted his senses. From the dark, damp underground tunnel to the light of a brilliant, **real** sun. From the smell of industrial pollution and mold to the smell of redwoods and wildflowers. He stood in a clearing, Stargate behind him, in the middle of a forest on another planet, with a Mars-like reddish moon in the sky.

And around him were actual trees! Seriously, dude, like actual trees! Not the holographic or plastic imitations that lined Arasaka's corporate offices. And there were real animals in the woods, local analogues of ground hogs, squirrels, curious cat-like creatures, horned rabbits, turtle-ducks, blue antelopes, and birds that he had never seen before. But actual animals, not the grotesque, tentacled monsters as alien creatures were depicted by Cyber-Earth cinemas. Monsters that could have never evolved naturally, that would have died of major organ failure within a week had they magically popped into existence. But here were real wild animals, and they seemed really friendly too!

He followed Velarion along the path through the woods, and soon they came upon a Concord village, with log houses and living, growing biodomes. The villagers came out to meet the new guy with genuinely happy and welcoming faces. Children huddled around, eager to catch a glimpse of the off-worlder. Farmers, Saiyans, elves, shinobi, and Rodnover elders all came to greet Gabriel. They embraced him with open arms. He has finally returned to his soul-family.

> “You are home, Starseed. And you are no longer alone.”

### The Quiet Forest

_A Concord Soul-Tale, as told by Velarion of the Space Elves_

The stars were silent above, not cold but calm — shimmering over the treetops of **Serenai**, a world so still you could hear your own heartbeat if you stopped pretending not to.

**Gabriel**, formerly of Night City, sat slumped on a mossy stone near the edge of a quiet grove. He hadn’t spoken for nearly half an hour. The cybernetic implant at the base of his neck, once pulsing faint blue, had gone dark days ago. No Wi-Fi here. No pings. No prompts.

Just the sound of **wind through leaves** and the flicker of **insects who didn’t ask permission to glow.**

Velarion, robed in soft green cloth that shimmered with dew, approached from the trees with a wooden cup in hand. Steam curled above it like incense smoke in a ruined temple. He offered it with both hands, bowing slightly.

> “Tea. Chamomile and something the Shinobi call Moonleaf. It helps loosen the digital grip on one’s nerves.”

Gabriel accepted it warily, like it might bite him. He glanced around.

> “How the hell does this place work? No power grid. No network. No traffic. No—”  
> _He trailed off, staring at the light filtering through the branches above._  
> “It’s like... nothing is trying to sell me anything.”

Velarion smiled, not smugly, but like someone who had heard this before from many pilgrims.

> “Nothing is trying to sell you anything. Because here, **you are not a product.** Nor a problem to be optimized.”

Gabriel took a sip. Closed his eyes. Sighed.

> “In Night City, everyone’s trying to be heard. Scream louder. Send more signals. Be noticed. Stay alive by being _online_.”

> “Yes,” Velarion said softly, “We know. We hear the screams from afar.”

Gabriel opened one eye.

> “Then why haven’t you answered? Why didn’t you reach us? Why didn’t the Pleiadians send a signal? I mean via interstellar radio transmissions. Why didn’t your bioships come down and tell us the truth?”

Velarion looked up, gaze catching the sun through the trees. He crouched beside Gabriel, placing one hand on the moss between them. His voice was gentle but firm.

> “Because we are not from the **Dark Forest.** We are from the **Quiet Forest.**”

Gabriel blinked.

> “...What?”

Velarion ran his fingers along the bark of a nearby tree. The roots responded, humming softly beneath them like the rhythm of a long-forgotten lullaby.

> “The Dark Forest is a story born of fear. In it, silence means danger. Stillness is a trap. Every shadow hides a predator.”  
> “But not all forests are dark.”  
> “Some are **quiet** because they are **listening.** Some do not scream into the void because they are not afraid of being alone. They are **complete**. Resonant.”

He turned to Gabriel, placing a hand on the man’s shoulder — a strange intimacy in a world that had trained him to flinch from touch.

> “You were not ignored. You were never invisible. But we would not come until your soul was ready to hear not with your ears...”  
> “...but with your heart.”

Gabriel’s hands trembled slightly on the wooden cup.

> “Then all those years... we searched the sky, listening for noise... and you were already there?”

Velarion nodded.

> “We were the **trees you paved over.**  
> The **wind you soundproofed against.**  
> The **dreams you forgot upon waking.**”

A bird called overhead — not mechanical, not named in any database, just... alive. Unnamed and unbought.

Gabriel stared into the tea.

> “So this is what heaven looks like?”

Velarion stood, smiling.

> “No.”  
> “But it might be what it _sounds_ like.”  
> “We are not the Empire. Not the Imperium. We are not machines in orbit. We are what comes when you stop listening for signals... and start listening for **silence**.”

He stepped back, leaving Gabriel alone beneath the canopy of stars and branches and memory.

And as the wind danced, the leaves whispered:

> **"Not Dark Forest... but Quiet Forest."**
