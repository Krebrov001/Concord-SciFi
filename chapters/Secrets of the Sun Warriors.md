Before the stargate was found on Veritus Prime by the Imperium of Man, before Mark Vrangell was sent on his fateful mission to Abydos with his troops, before the Stargate Crusade was even conceived, on a planet that the Imperials never knew even existed, on a planet that was recovering after a world war, some time during the 41st millennium of the galaxy, a certain discovery was made.

But these events had not gone unobserved.

On a distant planet far far away, on a capital world of an advanced spacefaring civilization with an ancient history ... there is a mountain range.

On the highest peak there is a temple or palace, within which is a throne room. A long-haired man sits on the throne, locked in a trance, observing the events that are taking place in the galaxy.

He has lived much, experienced much, yet his facial appearance is neither withered nor decayed. His form inspires awe, his wisdom inspires reverence, his body softly illuminates the dark room with his presence alone.

A Sovereign, A Teacher, A Wizard, An Enigma.

On the crystal throne he sits, clad in a blue and white robe, skin pale as freshly fallen snow, hair a radiant gold, piercing blue eyes closed in a trance. With his powers of remote viewing he sees distantly occurring events. A kind of trance, not unlike being in a dream, but used for acquiring information via non-physical means, an undetectable technique.

His name is Ashtar Sheran. The planet is Taygeta, the capital world of the Pleiadian civilization, an ancient mirror of humanity. Elusive, magical, archaic. A civilization of humanoids with a very high level of spiritual development.

He opens his eyes, breaking the trance and returning back to his body and the dimly lit throne room. 

And he exclaims approvingly, **"Yes, It begins."
