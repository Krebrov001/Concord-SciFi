**"By His Will, Through My Pen"**  
_A story of quiet heresy within the Imperium of Man_  
_Concord Saga: Shadows of Bureaucracy_

---

**Sector Veritus Gamma. Administratum Sub-Hive 9.**

Scribe-Magister **Tiber Orelian** sat hunched over a cracked dataslate, his arthritic fingers dancing with trembling devotion over the rune-keys. His office was a coffin of parchment and incense smoke, lit by flickering lumen-strips and the weak glow of sacred monitors. Behind him, wall-etched prayers to the God-Emperor loomed large in gold filigree.

Outside, the Hive City roared its ceaseless dirge: manufactoria fires, shrieking alarms, and the drone-chant of the Adeptus Mechanicus echoing off rusted spires. Tiber paid it no mind.

He was writing **names**.

Forged names. Legitimacy conjured out of thin air.

A "Concord Agriculture Liaison."  
A "Xenobotanical Consultant from Ando Primus."  
A "Visiting Archivist from Luthien IX."

All false. All real enough.

Their bearer—an elfkin woman with impossible ears and living wood woven into her robes—had smiled at him, thanked him softly, and vanished into the crowd. He had offered a prayer afterward. Not to the Omnissiah. Not to the Inquisition. But to **Him**.

To the **Emperor**—or rather, **Ashtar Sheran**, as he had come to believe the true name was.

---

### _Tiber's Revelation_

He hadn't always been like this.

Once, Tiber had served the Administratum with unthinking zeal. He filed compliance forms for tithe shortfalls, condemned millions to starvation with the stroke of a stylus, and assigned entire regiments to death based on numbers alone. He was a model scribe. A perfect cog.

But then, during a reclassification review of obscure agri-worlds in Segmentum Pacificus, he had stumbled upon **inconsistencies**. Entire planets listed as “decommissioned” were now brimming with life. Biodata showed explosive growth in terraforming, advanced social cohesion, even spiritual awakenings. And yet... no known Imperial agency had authorized it.

He found records of wooden spacecraft. Reports dismissed as heretical lies.

Whispers of a being named **Ashtar** appearing to primitives in dreams.

He laughed at first. Then he _read more_.

He saw art from those worlds: radiant men with long hair and eyes like twin suns, standing beside an elven woman dressed in white, holding hands beside a spirit-gate. The man looked **exactly** like the earliest depictions of the God-Emperor from pre-M27—before the iconoclasts and grimdark theology sanitized the faith.

In the texts of fringe sects—the prohibited **Luminous Scrolls of Calth**—he found the phrase: _"The Emperor shall walk again among us, cloaked in light, when machines choke the soul."_

And Tiber believed.

---

### _The Secret Work_

No one suspected him.

He wore the proper sigils. Attended the Imperial Mass. Condemned heresy loudly.

But at night, when the Office of Records dimmed and his underlings went home, he _rewrote_.

He hacked the planetary migratory database using codes he wasn’t supposed to know. He forged passes for Concord mages, Saiyan wanderers, and shinobi in civilian clothing. He didn’t ask them questions. He just told them:

> “You’re cleared to enter Hive Telamon. Keep your head down. Don’t let the Inquisition smell you.”

Sometimes they would thank him. Once, a bender girl from the Water Tribe touched his hand and said: “You serve the true flame.”

He nearly wept.

---

### _Ambiguity_

He never told anyone. Not even his confessor. Not even the data-shrines he whispered to in the Machine Tongue.

In his office, he kept a tiny, _hidden icon_. It depicted the classical God-Emperor on one side—throne, sword, halo—and on the reverse, **Ashtar Sheran**, smiling beneath a sunlit sky, standing beside an elf-woman in a field of tulips.

Two sides. One being.  
He believed it.  
But no one else did.  
And maybe no one should.

---

### _Endgame?_

Tiber didn’t know what the future held. Maybe he was just a deluded fool. Maybe the Inquisition would eventually discover his quiet treason and flay him alive. Maybe Ashtar Sheran was just a Pleiadian mystic playing at divinity.

But it didn’t matter.

He would keep authorizing safe passage. He would keep guiding Concord agents with paper and ink and silence.

> “Through me,” he once whispered, stamping a visa for a Saiyan warrior in monk’s robes, “His will is done.”

---

**In the deepest, darkest archives of the Administratum, a quiet rebellion flourished—written not in blood, but in bureaucracy.**

And perhaps that, more than any crusade or holy war, was how the Imperium would one day be _liberated_.

---

**"By His Will, Through My Pen" – Part II**  
_The Quiet Heresy of Tiber Orelian Continues_

---

**Administratum Sub-Hive 9, Week of Auditus Sanctus**  
The _Inquisitorial Mind-Probe Team_ arrived without warning.

They came in black. Black rosettes, black coats, black scowls. Cogitators hummed behind them, trailing servo-skulls and floating data-spiders. A dozen clerks were lined up outside Tiber Orelian’s office, wide-eyed and pale, already whispering the name in fear.

> “The forger is among you,” barked Inquisitor Melkior, gaunt and cold, “and we will extract the truth with all the blessings of His Holy Inquisition.”

Tiber didn’t flinch.

He tucked a parchment into a data-sarcophagus and calmly rose. His hands didn’t shake. His thoughts were still.

After all, he had _nothing to fear_. Not because he was innocent. But because he was _devout_.

---

### _The Interview_

In a chamber soaked in incense and lit by electrocandles, Tiber Orelian sat across from the Inquisitor.

He answered every question. Perfectly. Fluently. Quoting from the _Principia Imperialis_, the _Codex Benedictionum_, and even the rarely memorized _Litany of Sanctified Appointments_. He even corrected the junior interrogator on the year of the 4th Tithing Recalibration.

He described his hatred of mutants and heretics in appropriately vague but passionate terms.

He described his faith in the **God-Emperor** as “eternal, undivided, and absolute.”

When asked if he believed the Emperor still lived, he replied:

> “Of course. He is beyond death. He walks with us in spirit... and perhaps one day, in flesh again, if He so chooses.”

It was an acceptable answer. Ambiguous, orthodox enough. Even poetic.

---

### _The Scan_

He passed the psychic scrutiny.

The Empath didn’t detect rebellion. The Cogitator Analysis flagged nothing abnormal. Even the Inquisitorial purity-seal on his robes was genuine, properly inked, blessed, and renewed on time for the last thirty-four years without fail.

He was, on paper and in soul, a _model servant_ of the Imperium.

> “Tiber Orelian,” Inquisitor Melkior declared, after cross-checking him with ten thousand compliance forms, “is incapable of treason. Remove him from the suspect list.”

The black-robed acolytes obeyed.

---

### _Aftermath_

They never found the forger. The paper trail had been too clean. The misdirection perfect. Some blamed xeno-sympathizers in the underhive. Others suspected an infiltrated rogue tech-priest.

No one ever looked again at the bent old man in the corner office of Sub-Hive 9, writing by candlelight, one stylus stroke at a time.

Tiber smiled as he returned to his desk.

Today, he would authorize travel visas for a group of _“environmental scholars from Andari Prime”_—a thinly veiled Elven diplomatic delegation from the Concord.

As he signed their entry forms, he whispered to himself:

> “Through my service, may His light spread.”

---

### _Reflections_

He had always believed.

He still believed.

That the God-Emperor was not dead, merely transformed—walking once again among the stars, not in gold and steel upon the Throne, but in blue robes, radiant eyes, and a gentle hand upon the shoulder of the meek.

He never said the name aloud. Not even in prayer. But in his heart, he whispered it.

**Ashtar.**

---

### _Ephemeral Canon_

Is it true?  
Was the Inquisition merely blind?  
Was he touched by the divine, or merely insane?

In the sprawling chaos of the galaxy, truth is often a matter of faith—and **faith**, as the Imperium well knows, is rarely rational.

Tiber's paperwork, however?

**Flawless.**

---

**"The Sky-Priest of Hive Dagon Delta"**  
_Segmentum Obscurus, Hive World Karavost_  
_Lower Hive - Sublevel G-917, Sprawl of Rust and Rain_

---

The smog above Hive Dagon Delta was so thick it dripped like grease. The air tasted like static. Vox-speakers crackled sermons on repeat, endlessly preaching Imperial Truth: _“He sits on the Golden Throne. He watches. He judges. He burns away the wicked.”_

No one really listened anymore. Not down here.

Down here, people didn’t look up unless something was falling.

Down here, they’d seen too many things fall.

And so when the old man with the silver hair and sky-colored cloak appeared, barefoot and babbling on the rain-slick ferrocrete, no one noticed him at first.

Not until he began shouting.

> “**He walks among us again!** The Radiant One! The Living Flame of Terra! The Emperor reborn! _Not in brass, not in wires, not in thrones!_ But in starlight and memory and the breath of the soul!”

People kept walking.

A servitor wheeled by, whirring softly, dragging its bulk past the preacher with mechanical indifference.

A worker in an oil-stained rebreather glanced up, then down again. Muttered:

> “Another warp-touched fool.”

---

The preacher climbed onto a rusted container. His voice cracked, but it carried.

> “_They tell you He is dead!_ That He rots on a throne! That He needs your blood to breathe, your sons for war! But I tell you—**He left. He escaped. He walks the stars! He calls Himself Ashtar now!** He’s not the corpse they worship in silence. He’s the thunder that stirs in the woods, the voice in the wind!”

Somebody laughed. A teenager. Threw a piece of synth-bread.

It hit the preacher’s shoulder. He didn’t flinch.

> “**I saw Him in my dreams!** He was in a garden that wasn’t a garden—it was a ship, a _living_ ship! With stars growing like fruit and leaves that glowed blue. And He told me: _'Tell them. Tell them I have not forsaken them.'_”

---

At a nearby tea stall, a tired woman whispered to her friend:

> “Why do the crazies always dress like nobles?”

“Because that’s what they think angels wear,” the friend replied. “Sky-blue and white. Soft things. Not like us.”

---

The preacher kept shouting.

> “_He is not the machine! He is not the war! He is not the purge!_ He is love! He is soul! He fights the soulless—he fights the machines! That’s why they hate Him! They sealed Him away! But **He broke free! He built a new realm—the Concord!**”

---

A group of enforcers walked by. One paused.

> “Should we...?”

The other shrugged. “He’s not hurting anyone. Let the mad rant. Keeps the real heretics busy.”

They moved on.

---

Still, the preacher continued. Even as his voice faded. Even as rain came.

> “He will return here. He will open the star-door. In the subways. Beneath this hive. He’ll lift the veil. You’ll see the trees again. The skies will open. And the soul-dead will fall. But you must—_must_—choose love. You must... choose... soul...”

His words trailed off into coughs.

The workers returned to their toil.

Children to their scavenge.

No one looked up.

Except one girl.

Just one.

She watched from behind a rusted pylon, clutching her scav-satchel.

She didn’t say a word. But when she walked away, her pace had slowed. Her eyes looked skyward—toward a sky she couldn’t see.

---

The next day, the preacher was gone.

A smear of silver fabric remained. And a symbol, crudely scratched into the ferrocrete wall behind where he had stood:

A spiral sun. A sword of light. A blooming tree.

And three words in Low Gothic, scrawled in a trembling hand:

> **“He walks again.”**

No one cleaned it up. No one dared.

The graffiti remains to this day.

Just another voice lost to the underhive wind.

Or perhaps... the first to be heard.

---

**Segmentum Solar – The Eternity Chamber, High Lords’ Conclave**
*Sanctioned Transcription: Debate Sealed under Echo-Grade Clearance*

---

The massive adamantium doors of the **Eternity Chamber** sealed with a groaning hiss, locking out the noise of Terra’s endless prayers. A single lumen-arch glowed cold above the obsidian roundtable.

Twelve Thrones. Twelve voices. One Imperium.

Today, however, they were not unified.

A dataslate clattered onto the table, reverberating with a tension no one dared break for several seconds.

> **“The Cult of the Radiant One,”** spoke Grand Provost Marshal Theodax, his voice low. “Reported on three agri-worlds, two underhives, and... disturbingly... on a Shrine World.”
>
> “They say the Emperor walks again. That He travels the stars in flesh. That He calls Himself—*Ashtar.*”

Murmurs.

Some Lords leaned forward. Others sneered.

---

### *Ecclesiarch Varnak*

(White-robed, flame-eyed, his crozius still dripping from the morning's executions)

> “Heretics. Plain and simple. We burn such rot wherever it appears. A false messiah in flowing robes? A Concord trick. A sorcerer in disguise.”

---

### *Fabricator-General Hestok of Mars*

(A thousand servo-limbs clicking in disapproval)

> “It reeks of *memetic warfare*. The Concord has long understood ideological warfare. This is not random. This is a campaign. Psychological infiltration through myth. The ‘Radiant One’ is no messiah—it is weaponized *narrative.*”

---

### *Naval Commander Andros Bel*

(Stiff, aging, wrapped in the pride of void conquests)

> “This may not be Concord propaganda at all. It may simply be peasants—*misunderstanding.* The Emperor’s Light is vast. Simple minds bend it into stories. Some elven-looking ghost whispers to a backwater fool and they start chanting nonsense.”

---

### *Inquisitor Lord Malveth*

(Silent until now, his eyes glowed faintly with sanctioned witch-sight)

> “Delusion is dangerous when it *spreads*. I have read the logs. These worshippers don’t reject the Emperor—they *worship Him more intensely*... because they believe He has *returned*. He brings healing. Mercy. Wisdom.”

He paused.

> “It is... disquieting.”

---

### *Master of the Administratum Vortegon*

(Paper-skinned, fingers like quills, voice like rustling parchment)

> “And yet... they remain obedient. They speak no ill of Terra. They still call Him Emperor. They tithe. They recite the creeds. But they decorate their icons in blue and silver, not gold. They paint... stars.”

---

### *Cardinal-Executor Sarephina*

(Young, ascendant, zealous to the core)

> “That is *heresy.* Heresy in subtle form is still heresy! We *cannot allow* a second name to be spoken in reverence alongside His. This... ‘Ashtar Sheran’... must be expunged.”

---

### *Speaker of the Astra Militarum, Lord Juran Althis*

(Speaking slowly, carefully)

> “We must tread carefully. Burn too hard and we risk making a martyr. Ignore it, and we risk losing *faithful worlds* to alien influence.”

---

### *The Lord Commander Militant of the Imperium*

(Only nodding once)

> “Let me be clear. If this ‘Ashtar’ is real... and if he *is* the Emperor in some new guise... then *we are the heretics.*”

Silence.

Heavy silence.

---

### *Fabricator-General Hestok, again*

> “That would imply the Omnissiah was... dethroned.”

> “Then let it remain a *rumor,*” snapped Ecclesiarch Varnak, slamming his fist. “We bury it. We purge the cults. We *do not* speak that name in these halls again!”

---

### *Conclusion of the Session*

* No consensus reached.
* Ecclesiarchy to increase surveillance and purges.
* Off-world Administratum to track memetic spread of blue-silver iconography.
* Inquisition given full authority to “contain and cleanse” as necessary.
* Concord to be watched not only militarily, but *ideologically*.

As the chamber emptied, Inquisitor Malveth lingered behind.

He traced the name *Ashtar Sheran* into his dataslate. Paused.

Deleted it.

But not from memory.

Here’s a short companion story—a darkly ironic encounter between **Krieger Hans** and a humble, wide-eyed believer in the “True Name” of the Emperor. It blends your intended humor, ambiguity, and the creeping infiltration of Concord soul-philosophy within the soul-dead Imperium.

---

## **“And His Name Was Ashtar”**

_A field tale from the Mid Era of the Concord Saga_  
_Location: Delta-442 Staging World, Post-Goa’uld Conflict Perimeter_

---

**Hans** of Krieg sat on his munitions crate, helmet on, gasmask filters purring, trying to eat a ration bar through the rebreather like he had every morning for the last 21 years.

He was tired. His trench coat was stained in Goa’uld ichor. His boots were full of moss. And worst of all, the recon camp was next to a Concord forward base. That meant—**other people**.

Today, Hans had been assigned latrine perimeter patrol. An honor, apparently.

He turned the corner of a mossy prefab building and stopped dead.

A man stood there. Civilian robes, wide-eyed expression, gleaming ID badge issued by the Administratum. He was pinning up a small poster—a drawing of the Emperor smiling, **smiling**, beside what looked suspiciously like a space elf and a… glowing gate of some kind.

The man turned and beamed.

> “Ave Imperator, brother!”

Hans narrowed his eyes behind the goggles.

> “You are not a Guardsman.”

> “Correct! I’m Tiberius-K class adjunct liaison. You may call me Brother Tyb. And may the True Light guide your soul!”

Hans blinked.

> “...The what?”

Tyb smiled warmly. “You serve the God-Emperor of Mankind, yes?”

Hans straightened. “Of course.”

> “Excellent. Then you’ll be thrilled to know His name.”

Pause.

> “Name?”

Tyb tapped the poster with a reverent finger.

> “Ashtar Sheran.”

Hans froze.

Something tingled in his brain. He had heard that name. _A long time ago._

---

Back on the rock world of Empyris Ridge, years before…

He had fetched water by a stream and met men in white plastoid armor—**Stormtroopers** from the Galactic Empire. There had been a misunderstanding. Something about both sides serving “the Emperor.”

One had said:

> “Praise Palpatine!”

And Hans, in his typical automatic Krieger fashion, had replied:

> “Praise be.”

Ever since, a part of his mind had stored the name **Palpatine** as the proper designation of the Emperor, though he'd never dared to mention it aloud.

And now this man said **Ashtar**.

Hans tilted his head.

> “I thought… the Emperor’s name was Palpatine.”

Tyb laughed, genuinely delighted.

> “Ah, you must be from one of the Divergent Sects! How wonderful! I meet many in your position who confuse the Radiant Avatar with the Fallen Pretender.”

Hans stared at him.

> “...What?”

> “Palpatine is a shadow—a false mask of Empire. But Ashtar is the soul of the Throne, the Breath behind the Flame, the Light that—”

Hans drew his laspistol.

> “Cease.”

Tyb raised his hands, unafraid.

> “No heresy here, brother. Only _rediscovery_. The God-Emperor never intended such darkness. You know this. You’ve seen the madness. The trench wars. The skulls. The endless death.”

Hans hesitated.

He remembered the corpses stacked like firewood on Yarik Prime. The priest who beat a man for sneezing during prayer. The days they were told to march directly into enemy plasma fire “as a test of devotion.”

> “...I serve.”

Tyb nodded. “So do I.”

Then he handed Hans a small card—just a piece of paper, but laced with Concord bio-fiber. On it, a quote:

> _“The soul of Mankind cannot be crushed.  
> It is not held by thrones, nor owned by priests.  
> It is a light that walks in secret.  
> It is waiting for you.”_

And beneath it, a signature:  
**—Ashtar Sheran**

---

That night, Hans didn’t burn the card.

He tucked it inside his ammo pouch, behind a purity seal.

He said nothing.

But in the months to come, when Concord emissaries passed through checkpoints, he never questioned them.

He just saluted and said:

> “By His Will.”

And never clarified which “His” he meant.

Would you like to continue this storyline with Hans becoming a Concord folk legend? Maybe his own platoon starts referring to “The Emperor Ashtar” and he has no idea why, but just rolls with it?
