**💬 Thread: “WHO TF ARE THESE HOODED BIO-FREAKS??”**  
**Posted by @GutterSight_XD**  
Okay this is NOT a drill. I work cleanup near the Arasaka South Gate and I *swear* I just saw a group of 3 people — no visible implants, no chromeware, no AR layer gear — walking around *barefoot*. Like, *on asphalt*. In robes. Talking about “the sickness of metal” and how “the forest remembers.”

One of them looked me straight in the eye and said, *“Your soul is not compatible with your casing.”* What does that even MEAN???

here's the continuation of the **Night City underground forum**, several weeks after the **first mysterious sightings** of the Concord emissaries. No one knows where they came from. But now, something stranger is happening:

They’re not being *seen* much anymore.

They’re being *felt*.

Their **ideas are spreading** — and no one knows where it's coming from.

**💬 Thread: “wtf is this ‘UNPLUG THE FLESH’ meme going around?”**  
**Posted by @MemeCleanse.exe**  
Anyone else seeing weird posts lately about “returning to the soil” or “shedding the casing”?  
People talking about pulling out their cyberware, going out into the Badlands barefoot, deleting their neuralware maps??  
And no one’s *saying why*. It’s like a vibe, not a movement.

Here's a series of forum posts formatted as messages exchanged via an _anonymous encrypted darknet board_, titled **[root@hollow-gate://threads/liberation-uplink]**, featuring **Lucyna Kushinada** and a handful of Night City edgerunners, netrunners, and anarcho-futurists. The posts occur shortly after the _first public whispers_ of the **Concord emissaries stepping through the Stargate** and showing a radically different way of life.

## 📂 INTERNAL MEMO – [CLASSIFIED | CORPO-EYES ONLY]  
**FROM:** ARASAKA MEMETIC CONTAINMENT OPS  
**TO:** C-SUITE, ALL DEPARTMENTS  
**SUBJECT:** CODE VERDANT: Anti-Concord Ideological Containment & Narrative Reinforcement

---

### 🧠 SITUATION OVERVIEW:

> **Threat Class:** Non-technological, non-networked ideological leakage  
> **Vector:** Word-of-mouth, physical presence, non-digital psychological influence  
> **Cultural Impact:** Rise in voluntary cyberware removal, corporate defection, disassociation with augmented identity  
> **Core Hazard:** *Non-violent memetic undermining of consumer identity systems*  
> **Codename:** *Concord Contagion*

---

### 🎯 PRIMARY STRATEGY: **Reverse Narrative Engineering**

> **Goal:** Reframe Concord values as **regressive**, **superstitious**, and **existentially dangerous** to individual freedom and urban progress.

#### Tactics:
1. **Discreditation Campaign** – Deploy pre-recorded “ex-druid” personas on social feeds claiming to have escaped from “eco-mind control cults.”  
2. **Humiliation Memes** – Viral content portraying Concord as “Space Amish,” “Magic Karens,” “Wood Wi-Fi Users,” etc.  
3. **Lifestyle Hacking** – Sponsor flashy campaigns celebrating extreme augmentation, “Choose Your Flesh,” “Own Your Self,” with glam influencers openly mocking anti-augment sentiment.  
4. **Subtle Threat Layering** – News segments on how “naturalists” are more vulnerable to disease, police profiling, or missing-person cases in the Badlands.

---

### 🛑 SECONDARY STRATEGY: **Psyche Re-anchoring**

> Re-entrench citizens' identity in their augmentations, using FOMO and emotional association.

#### Tactics:
- **Augment Nostalgia Ads** – “Remember your first implant? That’s when you became *you*.”  
- **Synthetic Body Positivity Campaigns** – “Your chrome is beautiful. Don’t let the past shame you.”  
- **“Meat is Weak” Merchandising Line** – Reinforce biological inferiority narratives.

---

### ⚔️ TERTIARY STRATEGY: **Black Ops PsyShield Deployment**

> Experimental tech to block Concord psychic-empathic resonance fields in key sectors.

#### Early Concepts:
- City-wide broadcast of “noise fields” tuned to disrupt Concord emotional harmonics.  
- Bio-electric aura distortion emitters in high-footfall districts (covert deployment).  
- Co-opting low-tier net shamans to develop “spiritual antivirals” — the irony is useful.

The trend is subtle. But **entropy begins at the edge.**

Here's a lively, heated online forum argument between **pro-Concord sympathizers** advocating unplugging from tech and civilization, versus **extreme pro-transhumanists** who champion relentless growth and augmentation, set in Night City’s underground net:
