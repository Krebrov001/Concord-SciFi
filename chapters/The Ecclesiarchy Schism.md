**Title: _The Crystal Heresy_**  
_A Comedy of Ecclesiarchs_

---

In the incense-choked halls of the Schola Progenium on Virex Minor, two senior Ecclesiarchs stood across from each other like thunderclouds preparing to collide.

**Ecclesiarch Belisarius Varro**, red-faced and sweating under his gilded mitre, slammed a fist on the marble altar.  

>"HERESY! Blasphemy upon blasphemy! You DARE claim the God-Emperor of Mankind has _relocated_ to the Crystal Throne of... _Taygeta_?!"

Opposite him stood **Ecclesiarch Pius Dominax**, wild-eyed, beard singed from an earlier incense accident, clutching a tome labeled _The True Testament of Ashtar_.  

>"I _see_ through the lies, Varro! The Golden Throne is a puppet theater! A rotting decoy powered by psyker meat! The _real_ Emperor walks among us as Ashtar Sheran—restored, radiant, and, yes, romantically involved with an Elven soul-maiden! What of it?!"

>"WHAT OF IT?!" Varro sputtered. "You think the Emperor—He Who Burned the Witch-King of Molech—would _date an ELF?!_"

>"Don’t be an _idiot_, Varro! You think He’d date _you_ instead?!"

Gasps erupted from nearby adepts and servo-skulls. One servo-skull dropped its censer entirely, clanging on the tiles. A choirboy fainted into the hymn organ.

"You slander the Mechanicus! You insult the Grand Liege of Mars!" Varro pointed an accusatory crozier. "Without the Omnissiah, we would still be using _buttons!_"

"And that’s the problem!" Dominax retorted, flinging open his ornate red-and-gold cassock like a magician about to perform. "The Omnissiah is a _rogue AI_! He’s been feeding you corpse-starch lies through the cogitators since M31!"

"BLASPHEMER!"  
"HERETEK-SYMPATHIZER!"  
"ASHTARITE!"  
"MARS-BOOTLICKER!"

The screaming match reached fever pitch until they both lunged forward, tripping over their robes. One grabbed the other’s crozier, the other yanked a beaded purity stole. Robes tore. Wigs flew. At one point, Dominax shouted, “I _saw_ him, Varro! He floated down in a vimana shaped like a flying mandala and offered me gluten-free biscuits of enlightenment!”

"You were high on incense!" Varro bellowed, tackling him into a statue of Saint Euphrasia the Slightly Flammable.

By the time the Canoness arrived to break it up (armed with a shock-maul and an exorcism playlist), both Ecclesiarchs were rolling on the floor shouting:

- "He rides a _bioship_ grown from a tree!"
    
- "The Emperor commands a _battleship_ forged from neutronium and _faith!_"
    
- "He has an _Elven_ girlfriend!"
    
- "He has a _bolter_—and celibacy!"
    

They were eventually separated and sentenced to three months of _Silent Prayer and Simultaneous Rosary Recalibration_.

Rumors persist to this day that Pius Dominax was later smuggled to Taygeta by a rogue Navigator and now lives in a biodome, writing _"The Crystal Codex – Volume 2: The God-Emperor’s Elven Honeymoon."_

As for Varro?

He's been appointed High Lector of the Forge Temple of Veritus Prime… where, rumor has it, he's begun questioning why the Omnissiah looks suspiciously like a washing machine with feelings.

_The Schism continues._  
_And the robes remain wrinkled._










**Scene Title: "The Unspoken Benediction"**  
_Location: Hive Tarsun, Upper Districts – Segmentum Solar, 10 years after the Stargate Crusade_  
_Characters: Marcus Vrangell (disguised, traveling under civilian clearance)_

---

Marcus Vrangell stood before the rusted bulkhead door, hand brushing the silver aquila pendant beneath his coat as if to reassure himself it was still there. He had dressed down—no commissar’s red piping, no sash, no peaked cap. Just a dark coat, worn gloves, and the kind of boots that blended in among the middling technocrats of Hive Tarsun’s quieter wards.

The whispers had reached him not through official channels, but through _chatter_—an overheard conversation in a Mechanicus transit lift, a muttered warning from an old Vostroyan subordinate. A heretical sect had taken root in a forgotten chapel of the God-Emperor.

Only, they didn’t call Him that.

They called Him… _Ashtar Sheran._

He pushed the door open.

---

The chapel was small, half-lit by flickering lumen rods and cracked stained glass that had long lost its color. A smell of candle wax and clean linen. The altar was of stone and vinewood—a living hybrid. No servo-skulls hovered. No incense burners choked the air.

A few dozen people knelt in the pews. Some old, some young. A few mothers holding infants. No fear. No desperate pleading. Only _stillness._

A man in pale robes stood at the pulpit, his voice serene:

> “He came not as a conqueror, but as a healer of the soul.  
> He who was once entombed on the Golden Throne… has been set free.  
> His name is Ashtar Sheran.  
> He walks among the tulip fields of Taygeta, not in power, but in love.  
> And we… are called to remember him, truly.”

Vrangell felt the words land like soft hammerblows. They were not spoken with fire. There was no command. Only… remembrance. Something ancient.

The stained glass behind the altar bore a rough, hand-painted figure—not the Imperium’s stern, armored Emperor with flaming sword—but a tall, golden-haired man standing beside a silver-haired woman beneath stars. Between them bloomed a single red tulip.

---

After the sermon, no one approached him.

He sat in the back pew long after the others had gone, watching the flickering light play on the vine-entwined walls.

In his coat pocket, his fingers curled around the old bolt pistol grip he still carried, reflexively.

> _“It’s blasphemy,”_ he thought. _“No sanction. No dogma. No proof.”_

But he hadn’t drawn his weapon.

He hadn’t spoken.

And when the priest walked past him in silence, merely offering a nod, Vrangell didn’t stop him.

---

**Later That Night**  
_In his hab-chamber overlooking the hive trench_

He poured a small measure of amasec, then poured it back. His reflection stared back at him from the ferroglass.

His voice, barely a whisper:

> “What if… he never wanted a throne?”  
> “What if the wars broke him… just like they broke me?”  
> “And what if… love is the only thing that ever saved anything?”

He pressed his forehead to the cool glass.

Then he sat at his desk and wrote nothing in his journal.

But he slept that night. For the first time in months, he slept without dreaming of executions.

And when the next day came, **he said nothing** to anyone. No reports. No charges.

Only silence.

A silence that echoed like a benediction.

**Scene Title: "The Visitor in the Stillness"**  
_Location: Hive Tarsun, Commissarial Quarters, Midnight – Year 10 Post-Stargate Crusade_

---

The lumen-globes were dimmed. Marcus Vrangell sat alone at his desk, surrounded by spartan furnishings—steel desk, regulation cot, oiled bolt pistol, a folded uniform that hadn’t been worn in weeks. The air recyclers hummed low overhead. Outside the hive’s ferrocrete lattice, thunder rolled through distant cyclonic storms.

He stared into the darkness of his room, not asleep, but not fully awake.

Then…

The hum _changed_. A resonance. Like music without sound.

He looked up.

And he was no longer alone.

---

The figure stood at the far side of the room, not entering through any door. **Luminous**, **tall**, and **tranquil**, draped in flowing blue and gold robes that shimmered like light refracted through water. His long blond hair fell gently behind him, and his face… was human. But ancient. Still. Knowing.

The very air bent around him, not in distortion, but in _harmony_.

Vrangell did not reach for his pistol. He _knew_.

He stood, slowly… then fell to his knees.

> “My Emperor.”

The figure stepped forward, silent. His voice was _everywhere_ in the room, yet soft.

> **“Rise, Marcus Vrangell. You are not my servant. You are my brother.”**

Vrangell hesitated, stunned. His mouth moved before his discipline could stop it:

> “I… I thought you were a myth. A dream of the lost. This form… this soul… How?”

The man smiled, not smug, but sad and radiant all at once.

> **“Because I was remembered. Not as a weapon. Not as a god. But as who I truly am.”**  
> **“You searched for me not in conquest, but in stillness. And so I came.”**

> “You are Ashtar Sheran,” Vrangell said slowly, as if shaping the words into stone.  
> “The Concord names you the true God-Emperor. Not the corpse… not the machine…”

His voice faltered. His hands trembled.

> “If this is heresy… I accept it.”

Ashtar knelt, placing a hand on Vrangell’s shoulder. It felt _warm_, _real_. Not a vision, but presence.

> **“You were loyal in fire. Now be loyal in peace.”**  
> **“The time of silent hearts has ended. The time of remembrance has begun.”**

> “What do I do now?” Vrangell asked, voice barely audible.

Ashtar stood, golden light beginning to retreat from the room.

> **“Remember who you are. And carry no flag but truth.”**

He began to fade.

> **“We will meet again, brother. Among the tulips.”**

---

**And then he was gone.**

The room was still. The silence complete. But it was no longer cold.

Marcus Vrangell stood slowly, touched the spot on his shoulder where the hand had rested.

He looked at his folded commissar coat… and turned away from it.

For the first time, he walked toward the chapel not out of curiosity… but out of love.

---

Would you like the next scene to be Vrangell’s quiet defection? Or perhaps his first open defense of the Concord before an Imperial tribunal?
