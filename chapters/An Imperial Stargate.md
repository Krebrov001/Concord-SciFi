## 📜 **Imperial Record: The Discovery of the Stargate on Veritus Prime**

**Segmentum: Solar
Subsector: Epsilon Minoris
Planet: Veritus Prime**

> *"By the grace of the Omnissiah, may our ignorance yield to sanctioned revelation. May we approach the unknowable not as heresy, but as relic."*
> —Logister-Magos Tertullian Rhox, Ordo Explorator

### 📅 *Circa M40, Year Unspecified*

Veritus Prime is a mid-tier Imperial world—unremarkable by most metrics of the Administratum, yet ancient in its settlement. It boasts several **partially decaying hive cities**, vast **agrarian breadbasket zones**, and tracts of **unclaimed wilderness** shrouded in ancient legends and forbidden zones. It was annexed during the **Great Crusade**, absorbed into the Imperium when compliance was given in exchange for survival.

Though long pacified, Veritus Prime harbors many **pre-Imperial secrets**, remnants of a techno-feudal civilization whose vaults were never fully purged by the initial Crusade forces.

### 🔍 The Ruin

During a **routine agri-expansion survey**, drones from Hive Phalanx-VI lost contact near a forested valley known in local folklore as “the Stone Hollow.” A Mechanicus patrol was dispatched to investigate. Deep within the crumbling remains of **a pre-Imperial vault complex**, buried beneath layers of sootrock and fungus-thorns, the patrol discovered something… impossible.

A ring—**nearly ten meters wide**, constructed of **unfamiliar alloys**, half-sunken into a dais of ancient stone and glowing circuitry. Its outer rim bore a system of **mechanical chevrons**, each marked with **symbols not recorded in the Lexmechanicum**. Beneath it were fused power conduits, neither plasma nor atomic in origin.

### 🛐 Initial Reaction: Cultic Excitement and Ecclesiastic Alarm

* The **Adeptus Mechanicus** immediately deemed the object a relic of the **Dark Age of Technology**—possibly a **transit engine**, or "macro-archaeoporter."
* A quarantine perimeter was established. Tech-priests engaged in initial prayer-sequences, data sanctification, and the usual binharic chanting protocols.
* The **Ecclesiarchy** protested. A local Confessor declared the ring a possible **“daemon maw”** and demanded its destruction.
* The Adeptus Mechanicus responded with a claim of **Technotheological Authority** under the Treaty of Mars. Tensions simmered.

Here is a **classified transcript** of a high-level discussion among **High Lords of Terra**, senior **Mechanicus Magi**, and a representative of the **Ecclesiarchy**, regarding the discovery of the Stargate on Veritus Prime. This is the moment the Imperium stands on the edge of unknowable rediscovery—torn between dogma, zealotry, and technological hunger.

### 🔒 **Imperial Transcript – Clearance: Aeternum Sigma**

**Subject:** Preliminary Findings and Authorization for Artifact V-Null-0 (Designate: “Macro-Archaeoporter”)
**Location:** The Hall of Concordant Governance, Terra
**Date:** Circa M40, Day Redacted
**Attending:**

* **Lord Fabricator-General Katan Vhul** (Adeptus Mechanicus, Mars)
* **High Lord Admiral Semion Benthos** (Navis Imperialis)
* **Ecclesiarch Holas Virek** (Ministorum)
* **Lord Militant Varian Hal** (Imperial Guard Command)
* **Lord Archivist Merex Osval** (Adeptus Administratum)

**LORD HAL:** *\[Gravelly tone]* Let the record show: we convene to deliberate the artifact discovered on Veritus Prime. Magos Rhox, illuminate us.

**RHox:** *\[Holo-image flickers slightly]* By your will. What we have uncovered is beyond categorization. The structure—ten meters in diameter, etched with untranslatable sigils—is composed of alloys unknown to the Mechanicus. It radiates no Warp presence, no corruption. It is inert, yet... expectant. We believe it to be a transit mechanism—interstellar or interdimensional.

**FABRICATOR-GENERAL Vhul:** *\[Voice a chorus of modulated binharic undertones layered beneath calm speech]* The Omnissiah’s blessings have not abandoned us. We have waited millennia to find something untainted from the Dark Age of Technology. This may be one such relic. My Magi have studied similar glyph-pattern harmonics only in corrupted STC fragments.

**ECCLESIARCH Virek:** *\[Slamming his staff against the marble floor]* Heresy! You flirt with a device whose origin is lost, whose function is blasphemous, whose presence calls to mind the fell designs of the warp-touched. How can we be sure it is not a daemon trap?

**INQUISITOR Vehr:** *\[Cold, calm]* It does not hum with the frequencies we associate with the Warp. No daemonic resonance. No psychic interference. Not even a scrap of taint. If anything, the silence is more unnerving.

**LORD OSVAL:** Then is it... human?

**MAGOS RHox:** Human *design*, almost certainly. But... not *Imperial*. Pre-Imperial. Possibly pre-Unity. The layout of the structure, its interface systems, suggest a technological maturity **unparalleled**—even by recovered STC.

**ADMIRAL Benthos:** Can it be activated?

**MAGOS RHox:** We believe so. It interfaces with energy signatures outside known spectra—possibly neutrino-based or zero-point derived. If authorized, my Ordo Explorator can establish an activation protocol.

**VIREK:** You would open an unsanctioned *gate*? To what?! Xenos domains? Hell-realms? Entire pantheons of corruption?

**FABRICATOR-GENERAL Vhul:** *\[Unflinching]* If the Emperor did not wish us to recover the tools of His age, He would not have buried them beneath our feet. The STC was no less dangerous—yet we bless each printout with incense and blood-oil.

**LORD HAL:** What do we stand to gain?

**MAGOS RHox:** Travel across thousands of light years in an instant. Access to lost human colonies. Technologies that predate the Heresy by millennia. If this is what we believe it is, it could eclipse even the Pharos of Sotha.

**INQUISITOR Vehr:** And if the device opens onto a xenos empire that should never have known of our existence?

**FABRICATOR-GENERAL Vhul:** *\[Turning head, mechanical tendrils twitching]* Then we shall burn it closed, and those who emerged from it with it.

**OSVAL:** Then we are agreed? We engage the device?

**\[Silence. Then one by one, nods.]**

**ECCLESIARCH Virek:** *\[Muttering]* I wash my hands of this. But if even one whisper of sorcery touches that gate... I will call for Exterminatus.

**HAL:** So noted.

**FABRICATOR-GENERAL Vhul:** Glory to the Machine-God. May His circuits guide our steps.

**MAGOS RHox:** *\[Solemnly, with reverence]* Then by your will, we shall awaken it.

### 🔧 **Ritual of Divine Activation**

The ring stood tall in the center of the excavation vault—now converted into a fortified chamber wrapped in plasteel and hololithic sigils. Holy banners of the Mechanicus fluttered in the forced ventilation. Servo-skulls floated in procession, trailing incense smoke and binharic psalms.

Surrounding the Stargate were **twelve Tech-Priests**, each stationed at a glowing terminal built into a sacred control lectern. Magos Rhox, robed in layered red and black, his mechadendrites twitching with reverent anticipation, raised one chrome-plated arm.

> **MAGOS RHOX:**
> *"By the Will of the Omnissiah, we seek permission to breach the seal of the stars. May the Machine-Spirit accept our data-tithes and lift the veil between lost brothers."*

One by one, the Tech-Priests inserted **mechanical datakeys**—etched rods encoded with numerical hymns—into the control lecterns. A **slow, pulsing drone** began, rising like a heartbeat, and the ring **lit up**, chevrons glowing with golden-white luminescence.

> *"Chevron one, sanctified."*
> *"Chevron two, locked."*
> *"Chevron three, acknowledged."*
> …
> *"Chevron seven—engaged."*

The ring spun, slowed, locked.

Then the roar.

A **whump-crack** of energy burst forth as a **vertical wall of luminous fluid** erupted inward—like liquid mercury being poured against invisible gravity. The surface **settled**, rippling like water under moonlight, a shimmering event horizon, forming a **stable vertical wormhole**.

Silence fell. The room glowed in the Stargate’s silver light.

## 🪖 **The First Steps Into the Unknown**

**Commissar Vrangell** turned toward Rhox, nodding. His power sword hummed softly at his hip.

> **VRANGELL:**
> “Thank you, Magos. Let’s see what your ancient machine leads us into.”

> **RHOX:**
> “The Omnissiah is already watching.”

> **GOVERNOR VANN-HOLT:** *\[Eyes wide]*
> “By the Throne… this shall make Veritus Prime remembered for a thousand years.”

> **COMMISSAR VRANGELL:** *\[Adjusts his cap, sternly]*
> “History is irrelevant. Discipline is eternal. Krieger forward.”

**Commissar Vrangell**, leading the way with pistol in raised hand, strode triumphantly through the portal.

A column of **Krieger Guardsmen** stepped in perfect formation toward the gate—gas masks hiding expression, lasguns locked. Behind them, **Vostroyan Firstborn**, elegant and traditional in their red trenchcoats and gold epaulets, marched with disciplined pride.

> *One by one, they entered the rippling gate and vanished.*

Flanked by servo-skulls, Rhox and two Enginseers stepped into the gate—and vanished.

## 🛕 **The World Beyond the Gate**

The air was dry. Dust filtered through the golden shafts of sunlight piercing cracks in the ceiling. The Stargate stood upon a **raised platform**, surrounded by **sandstone walls**, **carved pillars**, and **painted frescoes** depicting figures with jackal heads, golden suns, and starships shaped like pyramids.

The gate room was a chamber of ancient grandeur—an **Egyptian-style temple**, half collapsed, but eerily well-preserved. Hieroglyphs lined the walls in patterns strangely familiar.

**Krieger squads** moved outward in fireteam formation, covering doors and shadowed alcoves. **Vostroyans took elevated positions**, aiming through cracked windows and archways.

**Commissar Vrangell** stepped onto the sand-covered floor and scanned the architecture.

> **VRANGELL:**
> “These columns… this design. We’ve seen this before. Back on Enoch Primus.
> That style was fashionable in the early Imperium. Baroque revival.
> We may be standing on a forgotten Imperial world.”

**Magos Rhox**, meanwhile, approached one of the frescoes with reverence. His optical augments clicked as they focused.

> **RHOX:**
> “No. Not *Imperial*.
> This is older. Terra’s *Ancient Egyptian* period. It predates the Emperor Himself.
> How could this style exist light-years from Sol?”

The interior of the temple was narrow and long, lined with ancient corridors carved from stone that somehow still bore **power conduits** embedded in the walls—long-dead, yet humming faintly to the auspex.

**Vostroyan spotlights** danced along the hieroglyphs, casting tall shadows of falcon-headed deities and starships that resembled flying obelisks. The **Krieger vanguard** moved ahead in total silence, their boots leaving prints in a fine layer of dust that had not been disturbed for millennia.

> **MAGOS RHOX:**
> *"These conduits... they speak of structured power systems unknown to our schema. Photonic? Hyperionic? This place is... humming."*

> **VRANGELL:**
> *"You’re giving it too much weight. This isn't the work of Terran antiquity.
> It's probably a revivalist construct. The early Imperium had a flair for mimicry out of historical reverence.
> Ancient Egypt was fashionable on dozens of worlds at the time. Such as Enoch Primus."*

> **RHOX:** *\[Almost whispering]*
> *“And yet… the proportions… the materials… the iconography—it all predates even the early Mars settlements. These aren't artistic reproductions. This is something older than memory.”*

The team emerged from the corridor’s far end through a final archway etched with concentric stars.

And then—**light**.

They stepped out onto a broad **stone platform**, the air dry and shimmering with heat. Before them stretched a sea of **sand**—in every direction, endless dunes rolling like waves frozen in golden amber.

The sky above was pale and cloudless. A sun, not Sol, burned overhead.

Slowly, the Imperials turned to look back.

Behind them stood a **colossal pyramid**, rising high into the hazy sky. Its **sheer perfection** in geometry was jarring. Each stone was precisely fitted. Gold-capped and flanked by broken statues of forgotten kings, the structure pulsed with ancient silence.

> **VRANGELL:**
> *"Throne preserve us."*

> **VOSTROYAN SERGEANT:**
> *"Commissar… the vox beacons can’t reach Veritus. The signal's not bouncing. We’re beyond the stars."*

> **KRIEGER SCOUT (monotone):**
> *"Desert environment. Pyramid origin confirmed. Life signs detected. Approaching from outer sectors. Awaiting engagement protocol."*

> **MAGOS RHOX:**
> *"We are not on Veritus Prime.
> This world is alien… but echoes us.
> Either we are in the presence of humanity’s long-lost past…"*

He turned slowly toward the horizon.

> *“…or something that shaped it.”*

Sand whipped across their boots. The soldiers fanned out—forming a perimeter at the pyramid's base.

The Vostroyans scanned the horizon with long-range auspex, picking up **low-level power signatures** and **metallic structures** partially buried beneath dunes. Kriegers quietly positioned lasgun turrets in a semicircle facing outward.

> **VRANGELL:**
> *"This changes everything.
> Governor Vann-Holt will soil himself with glory.
> But until we know more—no word leaves this gate.
> No pilgrim songs. No xenos lore. No myths.
> Only silence."*

> **RHOX:**
> *“Understood, Commissar.
> But we should move quickly.
> If this is a functional system…
> There may be others who know how to use it.”*

---

They had arrived on **Abydos**. But they did not yet know the name. All they knew was the sand, the pyramid, and the strange architecture that whispered something terrible and beautiful about mankind’s forgotten place in the stars.

---

## 🧭 **Determining Location**

The **Mechanicus team** deployed long-range astromantic instruments atop the pyramid while the soldiers held defensive positions. A **quadcoded orbital triangulation array** unfolded from servo-drone racks, casting humming lattice-fields into the air. Rhox and his attendants chanted data-canticles while interpreting stellar patterns.

> **MAGOS RHOX:**  
> _“Confirming galactic orientation… local starscape does not match Veritus Prime's charts.  
> Cross-referencing with Imperial Astronomica… realignment complete.”_  
> _“We are no longer within the Galactic Core. This world lies in the periphery sector,  
> possibly within Subsector Delta-Rho of the Segmentum Obscurus._*  
> Distance from Fort Sanctus: in excess of 11,000 light-years."*

> **VRANGELL:**  
> _“Impossible. We didn’t board a ship. We didn’t even _move._  
> The gate is instantaneous?”_

> **RHox:**  
> _“It defies known warp translation, lacks a Gellar field, and yet traverses great distance without time dilation.  
> This is not warp travel. This is something else.”_

> **VOSTROYAN LIEUTENANT:**  
> _“Then we are stranded, Commissar?”_

> **VRANGELL:**  
> _“Not stranded. Garrisoned. And we now hold a gate.”_

## 🏘️ **The First Encounter – Village on Abydos**

From the top of the temple steps, the scouts spotted it—**a settlement nestled within a shallow basin**, half a day's march through blistering heat. The structures were **mud-brick**, dome-roofed, and surrounded by primitive irrigation canals. Small human figures moved between them: **farmers**, **children**, **livestock herders**.

> **VRANGELL:**  
> _“Primitive. We must have stumbled upon a feudal world, then.  
> Excellent. Easy compliance.”_

The column moved with precision, kicking up dust as they approached the village. Locals stared with wide eyes—first at the **silver-armored Kriegers**, then the **gleaming Vostroyans**, then at the **red-robed priests of Mars** trailing servo-skulls.

One **village elder**, gray-bearded and robed in linen, stepped forward. His back was bent, but his eyes were shrewd. He bowed his head slightly.

> **VILLAGE ELDER:**  
> _“Travelers. Warriors. From the gods above. Welcome.  
> What… god do you serve?”_

> **VOSTROYAN SCOUT:**  
> _“He speaks Low Gothic!”_

> **MAGOS RHOX:** _[Surprised]_  
> _“Remarkably pure dialect… possible linguistic preservation over millennia… or artificial seeding?”_

But the Imperials, trained to answer such a question reflexively, didn't hesitate.

> **ALL GUARDSMEN, IN UNISON:**  
> _“The God-Emperor of Mankind!”_

> **VRANGELL:** _[Stepping forward proudly]_  
> _“Yes, the Master of Terra, the Savior of Humanity, the Shield of Civilization!  
> He is the Flame of Reason, the Warden of the Warp, the Lord of All Souls.  
> It is by His will that mankind tames the stars and casts down the mutant, the witch, and the xenos.  
> And it is by _His divine providence_ that we now return to this lost world…  
> to bring it once again into the _light of Imperial truth._  
> Rejoice, citizen! For today, your world rejoins the Imperium!”_

The **village elder’s smile remains fixed**, but inside, his mind is spinning.

> _Double-headed eagle… militant uniformity… religious fervor… these are surely Jaffa,  
> but not of Ra, Apophis, or Heru’ur. A new god-lord, perhaps?  
> The God-Emperor… a Goa’uld by another name? Have they renamed themselves again?_

But he **bows deeply**, as is wise under such circumstances.

> **VILLAGE ELDER:**  
> _“Yes. Yes, noble ones. We… we are honored to welcome your light again.”_

> **VRANGELL:**  
> _“Excellent. See, Magos? No resistance. They remember what they once were, even if dimly.  
> Now let’s find their scribes, their leaders, their records. We must assess population, resource viability,  
> and begin compliance protocols.”_

> **RHox:**  
> _“And initiate sacred data extraction. This settlement may hold… forgotten truths.”_

> **VRANGELL:**  
> _“Indeed. Let it be known—this day, this world is reclaimed for the Imperium.”_

---

_The sun above Abydos beat down upon them, but the fire of the Imperium burned brighter._

Unbeknownst to them, they had **entered a world long oppressed by false gods**, and now—ironically—**claimed it in the name of another**. The villagers only knew to bow and survive.
