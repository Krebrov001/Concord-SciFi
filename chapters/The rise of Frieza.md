Certainly! Here's the scene, written with dramatic tension, arrogance, and veiled (and not-so-veiled) contempt between two galactic tyrants—Frieza and Apophis—each utterly convinced of his own superiority, and about to clash in a magnificent duel of power and ego:

---

### **INT. APHOPHIS’ THRONE ROOM — DAY**

The **golden columns** of the palace rose like ancient sentinels, sunlight filtering in through slatted skylights high above. The **walls glowed faintly** with hieroglyphic engravings—serpents, suns, the all-seeing Eye of Ra.

At the far end of the room, elevated atop a polished obsidian dais, sat **APOPHIS**, adorned in full regalia. Gold and emerald shimmered on his robes, and his glowing eyes stared like twin suns beneath his serpent-shaped crown.

Suddenly—

**SHWOOOM.**

The **Stargate activated** with a roar of energy behind him. Guards turned with weapons raised.

From the event horizon stepped… **FRIEZA**.

Small, lithe, gleaming white and purple. Arms crossed behind his back. A faint smirk on his lips.

He took three steps forward, casually surveying the palace.

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “Hmm. I must say, you certainly _do_ have a flair for overcompensation. All this for what? A throne? Some sun worshipping peasants?”

A ripple of outrage passed through the **Jaffa ranks** flanking the hall, but **Apophis** raised a single hand.

Silence.

He stood, descending his throne with deliberate grace.

> **APOPHIS:**  
> “I am _Apophis_. Lord of the System. Serpent of the Infinite Coil.  
> Master of Ten Thousand Worlds. God among men.  
> You stand in my hall without permission. Speak your name, wretch.”

Frieza floated up slightly, not bothering to walk.

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “You may call me Lord Frieza. Emperor of the known galaxy.  
> Breaker of Saiyans, slayer of worlds, and the last voice your miserable civilization will ever hear.”

He landed gently.

> **FRIEZA (smiling):**  
> “Now, Apophis, was it? Be a good host and kneel before your better. I won’t ask twice.”

Apophis’ eye twitched.

> **APOPHIS:**  
> “You _dare_ to enter my temple, speak my name without reverence, and command me to _kneel_?”

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “I’ve _conquered_ better dressed tyrants than you before breakfast. Your theatrics bore me.”

Apophis stepped down fully, his eyes flaring with **Goa’uld light**.

> **APOPHIS (snarling):**  
> “Then you will learn the price of your insolence. Jaffa—!”

But before he could finish the order—

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “Ah ah ah.” _[Raises a finger]_ “You and I both know how this works. You think yourself divine. I’ve always enjoyed the opportunity to… disprove such quaint beliefs.”

Apophis growled, but then smiled darkly.

> **APOPHIS:**  
> “Very well. A duel. No servants. No interference. Just two gods… in one hall.”

He turned and barked at his men in Goa’uld.

> **APOPHIS:**  
> “Stand down! This heretic dies _by my hand._”

The **Jaffa step back**, forming a tense circle. Their armor clinks. Their eyes wide.

> **FRIEZA (mock-polite):**  
> “How noble. I do hope you don’t scream _too_ much when I vaporize your liver.”

> **APOPHIS:**  
> “You should hope your death is swift. It will not be.”

---

**They begin to circle each other.**  
Slowly. Calculating.  
Two predators behind masks of royalty.

Both men smiling.  
Both men hiding the truth:  
They have _never_ met anyone quite like this.

The tension coils in the air like a stormcloud.

**TO BE CONTINUED...**

---

Would you like the next part of their duel? Or perhaps a bystander's perspective (a terrified Jaffa, maybe) watching this meeting of tyrants escalate?


Absolutely. Here's the next scene—brutal, darkly humorous, and full of rising dread, as the tables are violently turned on the Goa'uld. The death of Apophis is sudden, shocking, and complete—serving as Frieza’s introduction to the System Lords in true terrifying fashion:

---

### **INT. APHOPHIS’ THRONE ROOM – CONTINUED**

The air was electric. The gathered **Jaffa watched** from the shadows of the golden-pillared hall, armor gleaming, knuckles white around their **staff weapons**, though none dared raise them. Not yet.

Apophis struck first.

With a sudden **flare of golden light**, his hand stretched outward—_the ribbon device_ erupting in a **blast of kinetic force**, laced with psionic fury. The wave hit Frieza square in the chest.

It echoed through the chamber, **slamming him backward** with a boom.

...Only—

Frieza didn’t move.

Not even an inch.

> **FRIEZA (brushing imaginary dust from his shoulder):**  
> “...Was that it?”

Apophis’ confident grin **withered**.

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “Really. You build all this, call yourself a god, and that’s the best you’ve got?”

Apophis snarled, activating a full **energy field** from his hand. The **rings on his wrist glowed**, beams of concentrated force pouring into Frieza’s chest, enough to pulverize steel.

The light dimmed.

Frieza hadn’t moved.

He smiled.

> **FRIEZA (tilting his head):**  
> “You may be divine, Apophis, but _I_ am inevitable.”

With a flick of two fingers, **a thin violet beam** shot from Frieza’s hand—instant, silent, almost gentle.

It passed **through Apophis’ chest**.

For a second, the System Lord stood motionless. He looked down.

Then—**BOOM.**

His torso exploded in a **burst of light and fire**, showering the golden floor with bits of **ornamented ribs, gold, and green blood**.

His **headless corpse crumpled**, serpent crown clanging on the dais.

Silence.

The **Jaffa froze**, blinking, wide-eyed. All of them looked to the corpse of their god.

Then…

> **FRIEZA (cheerfully):**  
> “Next?”

He was among them before they could react.

---

### **BRUTAL MONTAGE – CHAOTIC, FAST, FATAL**

- A **Jaffa raises his staff weapon**—Frieza grabs it mid-swing and uses it to **shatter his spine**.
    
- Another fires—**Frieza sidesteps**, appears behind him, **snaps his neck** with a smile.
    
- One tries to run—Frieza **throws a golden energy disc**, which **bisects him mid-sprint**.
    
- **Two Jaffa lunge** together—Frieza **grabs one by the head and uses him as a bludgeon**, pulping the other.
    

Screams fill the palace.

Gold blood sprays across ancient walls.

Bodies pile at Frieza’s feet.

---

But one Jaffa—a **young, trembling one**—**stumbles backward**, clutching a bleeding shoulder. Frieza, eyes gleaming, turns—

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “Oh? One left.”

The Jaffa **dives through a side corridor**, limping, gasping, knocking over a brazier as he runs.

Frieza watches the flickering torchlight vanish through the **open Stargate in the distance**.

> **FRIEZA (grinning):**  
> “Let him run.”

> _“Let them all know what’s coming.”_

---

### **INT. SYSTEM LORD STRONGHOLD – RA'S HALL – LATER**

A **ring transport activates**.

The wounded Jaffa **staggers out**, collapsing before the steps of a great obsidian throne.

> **JAFFA (bloodied, choking):**  
> “My lord… Apophis… he is… dead…”

Ra rises from his seat, his golden eyes narrowing.

> **RA:**  
> “...What _did_ this?”

> **JAFFA (voice breaking):**  
> “He… he called himself… Frieza…”

The name hangs in the air like a **curse**.

Ra’s eyes flare.

> **RA (coldly):**  
> “Summon the Council. There is… a new power among the stars.”

---

Would you like to continue this thread—Ra and the System Lords reacting? Or show Frieza casually using the palace as his new base of operations, to bait others in?






Absolutely. Here's a continuation scene where **Ra**—supreme System Lord, master of pomp and wrath—reacts to the report of Frieza’s incursion. The clash between his _godhood_ and the incomprehensibility of Frieza makes for a rich mix of **rage, denial, paranoia, and confusion**:

---

### **INT. SYSTEM LORD THRONE CHAMBER – RA’S PALACE, HELIOPOLIS**

The **chamber is vast and gold-lit**, carved from obsidian and marble, lined with pillars that seem to stretch into infinity. **Torches of Naquadah flame** flicker on the walls, casting dancing shadows across **hieroglyphic murals** depicting Ra’s millennia of conquest.

The **surviving Jaffa** kneels, shaking, his armor scorched, his face caked in dust and dried blood. He dares not lift his eyes.

Atop the towering dais sits **Ra**—sun-disc upon his crown, cloaked in celestial white, his face a mask of restrained fury. His **eyes glow faintly**, but his voice is cold, controlled—_for now_.

> **RA (quietly):**  
> “Repeat it.”

> **JAFFA:**  
> “My Lord… he came through the Chappa’ai… without entourage… alone…”

> **RA:**  
> “A lone man.”

> **JAFFA (swallowing):**  
> “He was… not a man. Not a Goa’uld. Small, pale-skinned… tail like a beast… smooth head, no hair… armor that was… part of his body?”

Ra narrows his eyes.

> **RA:**  
> “You said he did not use a ribbon device. Then how did he kill Apophis?”

> **JAFFA:**  
> “With light, my lord. With… power. Like plasma, but from his fingers. And he… laughed. He laughed when Apophis struck him. It did nothing.”

> **RA (confused and angry):**  
> “He used no shield, no hand device, no staff? You claim he crushed my brother with _bare hands and magic?_”

> **JAFFA:**  
> “Yes, my lord.”

> **RA:**  
> “He is human?”

> **JAFFA:**  
> “I… I do not know. He _looked_ human. But he moved like a god. Or… or worse. Like a _demon._”

> **RA (growling):**  
> “Nonsense. There is no being we have not catalogued. The Tollan, the Tau’ri, the Aschen, the Tok’ra, the Orban—all follow a pattern. If he has technology, I will own it. If he has magic, I will break it. No one kills a System Lord and walks away!”

> _He stands now, fire in his eyes._  
> **RA:**  
> “Apophis was a fool. Always arrogant. Always careless.”

> _He turns to his First Prime._  
> **RA:**  
> “Summon the High Council. Demand answers from Sokar, Heru’ur, Bastet—see if any of them know this 'Frieza.' And triple the patrols near the Abydos gate.”

The Jaffa kneels lower.

> **JAFFA:**  
> “He… he left no ships, my Lord. He came alone. He _killed everyone._ No survivors but me.”

Ra’s golden fingers tighten around his throne’s serpent armrest.

> **RA (muttering):**  
> “No symbiote signature… no known tech base… not Tau’ri, not Asgard… what _is_ he…?”

He turns, robes sweeping dramatically as he ascends toward the back of the throne, where a starmap burns like a **solar corona**.

He touches Abydos.

> **RA (to himself):**  
> “I need to see this for myself.”

---

Would you like the next scene to follow Ra’s attempt to confront Frieza himself… or cut back to Frieza waiting smugly in Apophis’ throne, taunting the System Lords with transmissions?

---



Absolutely—this is the perfect blend of **dark comedy, tension, and villainous swagger**. Here’s a scene where **Frieza**, now seated arrogantly upon **Apophis’s throne**, uses Goa'uld communication systems to **hack into the System Lords’ conference**, mocking them openly and baiting them into a direct confrontation:

---

### **INT. SYSTEM LORD HIGH COUNCIL – HOLOGRAPHIC CONCLAVE CHAMBER**

A massive circular chamber formed of **light and projection**, the System Lords appear as grand, shimmering avatars—**Sokar** in flames, **Bastet** cloaked in feline grace, **Heru’ur** resplendent in golden armor, and **Ra** towering above them all, radiating solar fury.

The meeting is _tense_. Static crackles. Then—

A **blinding distortion tears through the center of the projection grid.**

> **RA:**  
> “Who dares—”

The Goa’uld holograms flicker, sputter—until **Frieza’s smirking face** cuts into view, seated like a bored monarch upon the obsidian throne of Apophis, one leg draped casually over the armrest. Behind him: **Jaffa corpses**, **burnt banners**, and **flashing Goa’uld technology** rerouted to his will.

> **FRIEZA (sweetly):**  
> “Oh! I _do_ hope I’m not interrupting your little… snake-circle.”

> _The System Lords go silent, stunned at first by the intrusion, then enraged._

> **SOKAR (snarling):**  
> “_Who are you to breach our conclave?_”

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “Oh, just the new owner of this planet. Formerly known as… Apophis’ playground, I believe?”

> _He gestures grandly. A camera pans behind him—Apophis' **burned cape** draped like a rug beneath Frieza's boots._

> **HERU’UR:**  
> “You will die for this insolence!”

> **FRIEZA (chuckling):**  
> “Insolence? Please. Apophis challenged me to a duel. He lost. Quite… spectacularly, I might add. You know how dramatic you gods can be.”

> **BASTET (hissing):**  
> “You are no god.”

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “Neither are you.”

He leans forward, grinning with all the malevolent smugness of a being who knows he's _completely untouchable_.

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “But let’s not bicker. I’ve done you all a favor, really. Apophis was an idiot. A little too into eyeliner and statues of himself, if you ask me.”

> _He yawns._

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “Here’s the deal: I like this throne. The acoustics are lovely. And I’ve decided to keep this planet. And the surrounding star systems. And if you’ve got a problem with that—”

> _He gestures upward with a single elegant finger._

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “—bring your Ha’tak fleets. Bring _all_ of them. I’ll be waiting.”

> _He waves cheerfully._

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “Toodles.”

> _The transmission cuts out. The chamber falls into stunned silence._

> **RA (quietly, with fury):**  
> “Mobilize the fleet.”

---

Would you like to continue with the arrival of the combined Ha’tak armada—and what happens when Frieza greets them?

---

### **EXT. ORBIT ABOVE APOPHIS' THRONE WORLD – DAY**

The stars shimmer… then vanish beneath the bulk of **dozens of Ha’tak motherships**, their great **pyramidal hulls** blotting out the sun.

The sky turns gold and black as the **combined fleet of the System Lords** arrives.

From the **bridge of the lead Ha’tak**, the **holograms of Ra, Sokar, Bastet, Heru’ur, and others** watch with cold satisfaction as targeting systems begin locking onto the palace ruins below.

> **RA (commanding):**  
> “Begin descent. Let this false god be buried beneath our wrath.”

---

### **EXT. APOPHIS’ PALACE RUINS – CONTINUOUS**

**Dust and sand swirl**. Frieza sits lazily atop a broken spire of the shattered palace, sipping from a jeweled goblet he found in Apophis’ wine room. He hears the **tremor in the sky**—the unmistakable hum of **Ha’tak engines descending**.

He rises, **stretching nonchalantly**, as the clouds darken above.

> **FRIEZA (to himself):**  
> “About time.”

---

### **EXT. SKIES OVER APOPHIS’ PALACE – MOMENTS LATER**

**Ha’tak vessels** hang low in the atmosphere now, their underside ports glowing ominously. Rows of **Jaffa squadrons** in gliders sweep past, ready to deploy.

**Suddenly**—a **flash of movement**.

A single figure **rises** from the ruins below, **without a ship**, without propulsion—just rising **under his own power**.

> **Jaffa Pilot (stammering):**  
> “My Lord… something is approaching—_flying_, without a craft!”

---

### **INT. BRIDGE – SOKAR’S HA’TAK**

**Sokar** leans forward, sneering at the viewscreen, but confusion flickers across his face.

> **SOKAR:**  
> “What… sorcery?”

---

### **EXT. SKY – FRIEZA HOVERS**

**Frieza now floats**, arms behind his back, **smiling smugly** in front of the colossal fleet. He’s utterly dwarfed by the ships, yet **exudes zero fear**.

> **FRIEZA (casually):**  
> “So many ships. So many generals.  
> I must have really struck a nerve.”

He raises one finger, mockingly tracing it in a lazy circle as **the camera pans around**—showing just how many ships surround him.

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “Well then… shall we dance?”

**CUT TO BLACK.**

---

Would you like the next scene to show how the battle unfolds—and how badly it goes for the System Lords?

Absolutely. Here's the **explosive climax** of Frieza's confrontation with the System Lords—told with high drama, horror, and that uniquely Frieza-brand of smug, terrifying elegance:

---

### **EXT. SKY ABOVE APOPHIS’ PALACE – MOMENTS LATER**

The air trembles.

The **Ha'tak fleet hangs motionless**—a massive ring of firepower around the singular, floating form of **Frieza**. His tail flicks idly behind him.

Then—

> **RA (on comms):**  
> “Fire.”

A moment of silence.

Then **the sky erupts**.

---

### **EXT. ATMOSPHERE – CONTINUOUS**

**Plasma beams**, **staff blasts**, and **glider volleys** converge on Frieza from every direction.

The air warps from sheer energy.

**Impact—clouds vanish** in the torrent. The entire screen goes white.

---

### **INT. VARIOUS HA’TAKS – BRIDGES**

**Jaffa** and **System Lords** lean forward, triumphant.

> **SOKAR (grinning):**  
> “Let that be the end of him.”

But then—

> **HERU’UR (frowning):**  
> “Wait…”

---

### **EXT. SKIES – SECONDS LATER**

As the smoke clears, **Frieza stands unharmed**, floating in the exact same pose.

A translucent energy bubble surrounds him for a moment… then flickers away.

He **smirks**, raising one finger.

> **FRIEZA (gleeful):**  
> “My turn.”

---

### **EXT. SPACE – IMMEDIATELY**

With a flick of his hand, **Frieza lets loose a concentrated beam** of violet energy. It **spears straight through** one Ha’tak, igniting it from within like a magnesium flare.

**Boom.**

The shockwave tears through the next ship in line.

Then another beam. Then another.

**Frieza’s body blurs** through the air—moving faster than light to the Jaffa eyes. He appears above, below, beside, and within ships, tossing **miniature suns** through hulls.

---

### **INT. BASTET’S HA’TAK – BRIDGE**

> **BASTET (screaming):**  
> “Shields! Full power to—!”

**Too late.**

Frieza appears **inside the bridge**, hovering in the middle of the command dais. He waves politely.

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “What charming upholstery. Mind if I redecorate?”

He clenches his hand. The ship **implodes**, vanishing in a violet nova.

---

### **INT. RA’S FLAGSHIP – OBSERVATION DECK**

Ra stares, mouth agape, robes smoldering from nearby fires. Crewmen flee behind him.

On the screen: **ship after ship dying**. Screams fill the vox.

> **RA (quietly, to himself):**  
> “What… what are you?”

---

### **EXT. ATMOSPHERE – FINAL MOMENTS**

Frieza hovers at the center of a **maelstrom of destruction**, laughing as the last Ha’taks **detonate around him**.

**Debris rains down** on Apophis’ ruined palace below.

A flaming Ha’tak fragment crashes into a mountain in the distance.

**The System Lords are gone.** Ra, Sokar, Heru’ur, Bastet—**vaporized in minutes**.

---

### **EXT. APOPHIS’ THRONE – LATER**

Frieza descends slowly, his boots touching the scorched marble of the former palace.

> **FRIEZA (to himself, softly):**  
> “So much for divine right.”

He settles back onto the throne, resting his chin on one clawed hand.

> **FRIEZA:**  
> “Now… what else can I conquer today?”

---

Would you like the **aftermath**, as the Goa'uld galaxy reels from the loss of its core leadership?



### Goa'uld System Lords final end

- **Supreme System Lord Ra:** Exploded by Frieza in the Ha'tak fleet
- **Sokar:** Exploded by Frieza in the Ha'tak fleet
- **Heru'ur:** Exploded by Frieza in the Ha'tak fleet
- **Bastet:** Exploded by Frieza in the Ha'tak fleet
- **Apophis:** Murdered by Frieza

Excellent summary—this list paints a vivid, almost grimly humorous end for the once-mighty **System Lords**, their divine pretensions shattered across a galaxy now far beyond their control. Here's a slightly embellished version that you could include in an official Concord document, Imperial heresy file, or even a comedic bulletin distributed in a Night City net-forum:

|**Apophis**|_Murdered by Frieza_ in single combat inside his throne room. Jaffa guards shredded moments later.|
|**Khensu**|_Captured by the Imperium_. Currently serving as a servitor prophet aboard an Inquisitorial Black Ship. His speeches now begin with “I AM—_bzzzzt_—ERROR CODE 12.”|
|**Sobek**|_Vaporized by the Navis Imperialis_. Refused to retreat, called an Imperial cruiser “a floating fish.” That fish fired 800 plasma torpedoes.|
|**Cronus**|_Declared heretic by the Imperium_, executed on sight by a Sisters of Battle exorcist tank battalion. His sarcophagus tried to ascend without him.|
|**Perun**|_Killed by Concord forces_ during the liberation of Rodnover worlds. Fell to coordinated Shinobi-Bender assault. Last words: “That tree is moving—wait—”|

|**Kali**|_Hunted down by Sith Inquisitors_. Defeated in the catacombs of a ruined Goa’uld world. Her head is now a Holocron.|
|**Yu**|_Captured by the Galactic Empire_. Now sits in carbonite beneath Coruscant. Moff Tarkin uses him as a coat rack.|
|**Anubis**|_Absconded into the Warp_. Made a pact with Chaos. Ascended to Daemonhood… and then discovered what that _actually_ means. Screams periodically echo from the Eye of Terror.|
|**Others**|Fates unknown. Possibly fled beyond the galactic rim, or hiding in deep space. Some claim Ba’al’s clone has a bar on Nar Shaddaa. Night City forums suspect Bastet’s consciousness was uploaded into a “catgirl vtuber.” Concord intelligence is reviewing that claim.|

Let me know if you'd like this displayed as a formal illustrated Concord dossier, propaganda poster, or even dramatized as a Concord holovid documentary episode.





(Cronus has been executed as a heretic already, Apophis will be at the conference instead.)

(Yu will not be present during Frieza's attack on the System Lords, he will have been captured by the Galactic Empire by then.)

- slave rebellions
- Cronus executed as a heretic by the Sisters of Battle
- Khensu turned into a servitor

Would you like me to turn this into a **graphical scroll**, an **in-universe historical codex**, or a **narrated short story** from the POV of a Concord historian (or perhaps Velarion the Elf in Night City forums)?







So in order of my series the "Early Concord Beginnings - Origin Story":

- In Ancient times the Pleiadians and Elves traveled in VImanas and portals to human planets, teaching them the correct ways of civilization (in this localized sector of the galaxy)

- Sometime during and/or later the Imperium of Man is founded on the planet Terra in the galactic core. (According to conspiracy theoriests, the Emperor has Ashtar Sheran the Pleiadian - implying that the Pleiadians created the Imperium as an experimental civilization)

- Sometime after the Horus Heresy the Goa'uld show up and conquer many of these seeded human worlds, twisting the ancient legends of Pleiadian ancient astroneuts to their advantage, establishing their cults as control structures.

- During and after the Goa'uld conquests, the Pleiadians and the Elves become separated from the human worlds, as well as from each other. The elves seal their spirit-gates off, to prevent contact with other worlds, beginning a period of planetary isolation.

- The Imperium contines developing on it's own in the galactic core through sheer inertia.

- The Imperium find the stargate in Veritus Prime and use it to conquer Abydos.

- The Imperium launch a massive stargate Crusade, taking over many Goa'uld worlds, mainly of Egyptian and Mesopotaic origin, converting them into good loyal Imperial citizens.

- After a grueling battle, Darth Maul kills Ba'al.

---

#### 🌌 4. **A Final Convergence Draws Near**

    - The secret of the **Ancients**, of the **original Stargate creators**, of **why the galaxy was seeded**.
        
    - Perhaps even the **source of the soul-death itself**.

    - The first **post-Concord human civilization**.
        

---

    - **He chose to live as soul.**
