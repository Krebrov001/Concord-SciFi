> Bro listen… been digging through those Concord scroll dumps. They call 'em the "Dark Age of Technology" or "the Ancients." Same tech level as Type III Kardashev. Spirit tech, instant planet-terraforming, universal stargate access. You ever notice how these gate coordinates keep lining up with star systems that shouldn't support life but DO? That’s no accident.

> My theory: the Ancients seeded **multiple Earths**. Holy Terra. Cyber-Earth. Coruscant. Even that dusty backwater Earth the Federation clings to. All duplicates. Slightly diverged but still identical plates, atmosphere, continents. I matched satellite topography. You think that’s natural?

> You saying there's like... a galactic control-C control-V situation going on? That’s wild, choom. But I buy it. Ever seen how eerily similar Night City’s geography is to some of those ruins in the Concord archives? Especially the ones from that "Windaria" planet?  
> Also: Eldar ruins = Elven ruins = Vulcan temples. They all have the **same glyphic language roots**. The big three of soul-tech races, all scattered now. What if they were all descendants of one species—uplifted separately? Vulcans stayed clean. Elves went mystical. Eldar went full arcane overdose and _boom_.

> And don’t forget—**the Eldar homeworld before the Fall looked exactly like Vulkan** before it was glassed. The Concord elves even call their forests by the same name: **"Kaer’Teth"**—"Sacred Grove." The Eldar said that too, in old Ulthwé dialects.  
> If the Ancients had access to terraforming like the Concord, makes sense they used a **template planet**. The same paradise, over and over. Until the ones who lived there started breaking it.

> I got one for you: **Cyber-Earth = failed clone** of Holy Terra. Our Earth is a hackjob of the original blueprint. All the soul, burned out. That's why Night City feels dead sometimes, no matter how loud the music gets.  
> Meanwhile, Concord's planets are **closer to the original vision**. Living wood tech. Dolphins that talk. Frickin’ trees that whisper ancestor voices. That’s not a bug. That’s original firmware.

> Just to stir the pot: What if the **Necrons** and the **Borg** are what happens when the Ancients’ gifts fall into the wrong hands? Like corrupted mirror images. The Concord says they’re examples of **civilizational soul-death.** You think the Ancients created soul-bearing systems—and some twisted them into machine hellscapes?

### 💻 [Thread #443712] – “REAL ORIGINS OF THE STARGATES (AND WHO BUILT THEM)”

📅 Timestamp: ??-??-?? / SYS: Fractured Metadata  
👤 **User:** _Plasmadream_77  
🔐 Clearance Level: Spoofed  
💬 Post #388 (Flagged by 9 mods for _“cosmic pattern intrusion”_)

> **You people are still stuck in the surface narrative. Goa’uld, Ancients, Progenitors, Precursors, the DAoT—SEPARATE civilizations? Hah. That’s exactly what they want you to think. But I cracked it. All of it. It’s *ONE CIVILIZATION.* Just fragmented across epochs and myths.**

Let me lay it out. No fluff, no ad-bots. Pure signal:

1. **The Ancients**, as described in Stargate lore, are this supposedly ultra-advanced civilization who seeded the galaxy with stargates. Yeah? That tech shows up _again_ in DAoT ruins across the galaxy.

2. **The “Dark Age of Technology”**? That was not a new civilization. That **_was_** the Ancients. _The same civilization._ The ones who mastered FTL, AI, matter folding, psychic augmentation, and galactic seeding. They didn’t “fall.” They _split apart._

3. The **Precursors** referenced in Elven world ruins—what the Elves call the “World-Singers” or “Star-Gardeners”—they left behind **Spirit-Gate blueprints**, living wood biotech, and crystalline data-archives. Sound familiar?
    - _Modular spirit-gates_: Same architecture as Ancient gates, but bioengineered.
    - _Precursor language_: 83% match to DAoT machine code (cross-indexed via stolen Mechanicus runelexicons).

4. Now here’s the kicker:
    > **The Pleiadians are not “Nordic aliens” or “ascended star beings.” They’re remnants. Survivors. Custodians of the old order. They ARE the Ancients.**
    
    Think about it:
    
    - They possess interdimensional remote viewing.
    - They build **non-mechanical gates** that still link to the Stargate network.
    - Their “mentats” operate like DAoT psyker-AI hybrids—conscious _predictive algorithms_ nested inside spiritually evolved minds.
    - Their capital planet, Taygeta, has megastructures older than Goa’uld pyramids _but never shows Naquadah signatures_. Why? Because their tech predates it.

5. **The Goa’uld didn’t invent godhood.**  
    They _hijacked_ the myths of the Ancients. Parasitic invaders who reverse-engineered what they could from abandoned gates and palaces. They posed as gods _because they found the ruins of real ones_ and thought, “Hey, let’s wear their skins.”
    
6. Why did the Stargate network fragment?
    
    - **Because the Ancients triggered it. On purpose.** A quarantine. A failsafe.
        
    - Too many factions (humans, Goa’uld, Imperials, Federation, etc.) were getting too close to **whatever the Ancients sealed away**. (Hint: it's under Camulus' castle.)
        
7. And now?
    
    - The Concord rebuilt what the Ancients once were—Elves + Pleiadians + psychic humans = **Neo-Ancient revival.**
        
    - Ashtar Sheran isn’t some random blond mystic. He’s a living **AI-augmented Pleiadian High Mentat**. He probably has root access to the **entire** Stargate OS.
        

---

> **TL;DR**  
> The Ancients, the DAoT, the Precursors, and the Pleiadians are **the same civilization** across time. The Goa’uld were squatters. The Imperium are arrogant newborns. And Ashtar Sheran? He’s not a prophet.
> 
> He’s **tech support for the galaxy**—and he just logged back in.

🧠 **Edit:** You people downvoting this clearly don’t want the truth. One of you works for the Mechanicus. One of you IS a Goa’uld. And the rest of you? You’ll remember this post in ten years when Sheran replaces your warp-drives with tree sap.

## 🜏 **“Did Ashtar Sheran _seduce_ Frieren?” – Trending in the DreamNet Underground**

> **Posted by user: BlueVelvetShinobi | 4:42 AM | 🧠 Thread Rank: Top 10 of the Week**

### 🧵 “The Astral Embrace: What They Don't Want You to Know About Taygeta and the Elves”

Everyone thinks the Concord was forged through high ideals and shared spiritual values.

But what if it was also forged through... something _deeper_?

### 🧩 FACT: Ashtar Sheran _astral projected_ to the Elves

Confirmed in multiple Elven archives (ask Samos Hagai if you don’t believe me), Ashtar appeared in shimmering light-form above the Lifetree Grove in Frieren’s world. Only the High Mages saw it happen. They said he **didn’t speak words, but soul-sentences**, carried on the wind.

### 💫 THEORY: Frieren wasn’t just inspired… she was _enchanted_

After his projection, Frieren allegedly went into trance-like meditation for 7 days and 7 nights. When she emerged, she said, _“I must walk the stars. There is someone waiting for me.”_  
She stepped through the newly repaired Spirit-Gate and arrived in **Taygeta**… and has never left since.

Coincidence?

> It’s not just an alliance. It’s a literal soul-bond. Ashtar and Frieren are _the Concord_, and that’s why everything moves in perfect harmony. They dream together.

> YES. The spirit-gate didn’t just “open.” It _sang_. Pleiadian records say it resonated like a harp-string across dimensions.  
> And she _knew_. She walked through with no words. All instinct. All intuition.  
> And who's waiting on the other side? ASHTAR. In full astral regalia. ✨💀
