# A Custodian in Paradise

## **A Scene from the Neo-Imperium**

### _The Empress and Her Guards_

**Location:** Terra, post-Red Logic Rebellion.  
**Era:** The Age of Reconciliation.  
**Status:** High alert but politely dignified. Also mildly awkward.

---

Through the grand processional avenue just outside the Imperial Palace grounds, lined with monumental architecture and statues of saints, the knights in shining golden armor, the Adeptus Custodes, are escorting an important dignitary of the Neo-Imperium.

Terran citizens look out the windows to see what's up, what this commotion is all about. The people of Terra lined the upper balconies, leaning out of weather-beaten hab-stacks and refurbished domes.

Gone are the High Lords, the Inquisitors, and the Ecclesiarchs, their souls consumed by the Omnissiah's soul-furnace during the Red Logic Rebellion. Instead the Custodians are escorting the Empress herself.

Among them strode the **Empress Frieren**, clad not in armor, but in a flowing robe of soft blue and silver thread. Her silver hair shimmered under Terra’s filtered daylight. 

Once, the Terrans had cheered for the High Lords.  
Now, they whispered in confusion... or awe.

---

**Terran Civilian #1 (looking out the windows):**
> "Look, they are escorting that elf girl through the streets."

**Terran Civilian #2 (peeking from a cracked Gothic arch window):**
> "Is that an **elf**? Why is an elf being escorted by the Adeptus Custodes?"

**Terran Civilian #3 (chewing corpse-starch bun):**
> "Pretty sure she’s the Empress now. Didn’t you read the proclamation?"

**Terran Civilian #2:**
> "I _tried_, but it was written in High Gothic, Enochian, and something called... Quenya?"

---

**Most Devout Former Priest of the Imperial Cult** (now a street bard draped in incense-soaked rags):

> "_LONG LIVE THE PERPETUAL EMPRESS!_  
> _Savior of the God-Emperor!_  
> _Redeemer of the Imperium!_  
> _Mistress of Memory and Soft Spells!_  
> _May her presence recompile our souls!_
> _May her light shine upon us eternally!_"

---

**Frieren** _(glancing toward the Custodian beside her)_:

> “He doesn’t have to do that, you know.”

**Custodian**  _(still 9 feet tall and very gold)_:
> “He is just like that. He has always done that. For six decades.  
> After the Red Logic Rebellion, singing hymns is the _only_ thing that keeps him from accidentally worshiping vending machines again. He is useless otherwise.”

**Frieren (with a sigh of gentle mercy):**

> “Then let him sing. If it uplifts even one soul... let him sing.”

---

**Suddenly—shimmering into existence like a psychic hologram—**  
**Ashtar Sheran** appears midair, glowing faintly blue in his astral projection form.

**Ashtar (waving cheerfully):**
> “Hey! Those are _my_ Custodes. I remember designing their armor. That shoulder-pad was _my_ idea.”

**Frieren (not looking at him, face faintly blushing):**

> “Darling, remember what you said... 20,000 years ago?”

**Ashtar (blinking):**

> “Uhh, which thing?”

**Frieren (gently but firmly):**

> “_‘Everything of mine is yours, and everything of yours is mine.’_”

> “You know very well that a soul-bond expires only upon soul-death.”

> “I will be taking them under my wing.”

**Custodes #0471 (stoic but internally panicking):**

> _Oh no... we’ve been jointly nationalized._

**Frieren (looking at the Custodes):**

> “Imagine, standing around like golden statues for 10,000 years, without proper compensation. You poor things.”

> “Well, since you boys have more gold on you than the entire Imperial treasury, we'll just have to find an alternative compensation.”

**Frieren (smirking):**
> “I have big plans for you, boys!”

### **"The Still Vigil"**

_Crystal Citadel of Taygeta – Hall of the Throne_

The chamber was vast and quiet—**too quiet**, thought Custodian Tyvar.

He stood at attention beside the **Crystal Throne**, its surface a slow-shifting kaleidoscope of light. The throne was **empty**, as it had been for weeks. The Emperor and Empress had gone walking again—off into the gardens, or forests, or perhaps to Windaria. They didn’t always say. No honor guards, no fanfare. Just… love.

Tyvar shifted slightly, the only movement that his previous job allowed, rules and regulations having seeped into his bones. And now he promoted to planet Taygeta. His golden armor caught the light of a passing **sunbeam refracted through crystalline vines** curling around the windows above.

He blinked. Slowly.

Across the chamber, Custodian Aeryon cleared his throat.

> “No riots. No heretics. Not even a minor skirmish.”

Tyvar replied, low and dry:

> “I escorted a farmer last week. He dropped his fruit basket near the gate. Apologized to me as if I were royalty.”

Aeryon nodded solemnly:

> “I assisted a girl who lost a tulip petal. She wept until her brother gave her another.”

They were **guardians of the most powerful being in the galaxy**—and yet here, on Taygeta, **there was nothing to guard against**. No cults. No insurrections. Not even bureaucrats to chastise.

Only birdsong outside.

Tyvar tilted his helmet slightly toward the window. The **view looked down across cascading terraces**, bioship landing pads grown into spiraled branches, and forests that breathed.

He inhaled through his rebreather and paused.

Then removed the helmet.

Air filled his lungs. Clean. **Sweet**, even. He blinked again, this time against tears.

> “Terra hasn’t smelled like this in ten thousand years.”

Behind them, a **Concord child wandered into the chamber**, saw the throne, looked at Tyvar and Aeryon, smiled—and waved.

They stood frozen.

> “Hello, golden tree men,” she giggled.  
> “Thank you for watching the chair.”

Then she skipped off again.

Aeryon turned slowly.

> “...Did we just get _thanked_?”

Tyvar:

> “By a _child._”

They stood in silence.

Then Tyvar spoke.

> “Maybe this is what it means to truly guard something.”

Aeryon:

> “To guard peace, not from war—but from _forgetting why it matters._”

And in the golden afternoon light, two titans of war stood vigil over **an empty throne**—and smiled, quietly, behind their masks.

### **"The Golden Sentinel and the Tulip Sea"**

_Outer Gardens of the Crystal Citadel – Taygeta_

The tulips whispered.

A breeze passed low across the fields, and with it came a rustling like silk over crystal, like prayers spoken by petals. The **Custodian** walked the path, golden armor gleaming beneath Taygeta’s twin moons, each mirrored faintly in his polished chestplate.

He was on patrol.

Or… at least, he had been.

There had been reports of **absolutely nothing happening**, which, in this place, counted as a serious threat to vigilance. So he walked—out through the arching stone-lattice gates of the palace, past the memory trees, and into the fields.

The **tulips** had no strategic value. No tactical advantage. No heretics hidden among them. Only color. **Fields of it.**

Reds and pinks, golden yellows and the palest violets. Miles of motion, rippling with the wind, under a sky painted by the fading orange of Taygeta’s setting sun.

He stopped.

For no reason. No enemy. No alert.

He just stopped.

A butterfly landed on his gauntlet. He stared at it, confused.

Then at the tulips.  
Then at the stars.

> _“How long… have I been standing here?”_

His internal chrono had **stopped ticking**. Or rather, he had stopped checking it. He had been trained to time every patrol to the second.

And yet now… time had softened. Blurred. Drifted.

> _“What is this place doing to me?”_

He took one step off the path.

Just one.

The tulips **parted** like silk curtains, and his armored feet gently pressed down into soft soil, ringed with moss and dew. He knelt—**an unthinkable act** back on Terra. No Custodian _kneels_ without battle, or ceremony, or death.

But here, it was just him, and the flowers, and the moonlight.

And then—he heard it. A **laugh**.

Light and melodic. A Concord child in the distance, walking with her mother through the outer fields.

> “Look, mama! It’s the gold man again! I think he’s _part_ of the garden now!”

He turned his head slowly. But he didn’t move.

The child waved again.

> “Don’t worry! We’ll bring you lunch tomorrow!”

And just like that, she was gone.

He looked back to the field, this endless, swaying sea of color and calm.

> _“I was forged for war,”_ he thought, _“but I was starved of wonder.”_

Somewhere far behind him, a vox-chime blinked politely from his belt communicator.

He didn’t answer.

Instead, the **silent titan remained**, half-sunk in the tulip field, like a golden statue built by love rather than command—**lost in stillness**, and finally, at long last…

...at peace.

### **"The Empress and the Forgotten Patrol"**

_Next Morning, Tulip Fields of Taygeta_

The sun rose slowly over Taygeta, filtering its golden light through the translucent arches of the **Crystal Citadel**, spilling into the garden paths like liquid warmth.

Somewhere in the **tulip fields**, still upright but motionless, stood a **Custodian**.

Helmet on. Spear gripped. Not a single flower crushed.

He had not moved in **twelve hours**.

> _“How did this happen?”_  
> _“I… let my guard down.”_  
> _“Dereliction of duty.”_

His internal systems had rebooted three times out of confusion. He had patrolled countless warzones, stood sentinel in the presence of High Lords, and guarded the Throne for centuries. He had never once abandoned his post.

Until now.

And yet—

He couldn’t move.

Because part of him didn’t want to.

But then—light footsteps. Soft. Graceful. Familiar.

**Frieren**, Empress of the Neo-Imperium, stepped into view, her long silvery hair catching the sun like threads of moonlight, her eyes full of subtle mischief.

She stopped a few paces from him, hands behind her back, gently rocking on her heels.

> **Frieren** (softly): “So… vigilant as ever. I see you’ve secured the tulips.”

The Custodian froze even stiffer, as if by sheer rigidity he could pretend to still be on active patrol.

> “Apologies, Your Radiance. I—this was not intentional. I lost track of— I humbly accept whatever reprimand is due. I—”

**Frieren** raised a hand, smiling faintly.

> **Frieren**: “Oh no, you’re good.”

He blinked behind the helmet.

> **Custodian**: “...I am?”

> **Frieren** (nodding toward the field): “You’re standing in one of the most peaceful places in the galaxy, on a world with no crime, no war, no enemies. You didn’t abandon your post. You _became_ the post.”

He fumbled mentally, trying to reconcile this with twenty thousand years of combat doctrine.

> **Custodian**: “But my purpose… my orders…”

> **Frieren** (gently): “Your orders are to protect the heart of the Imperium. Sometimes, that means standing tall in a warzone. And sometimes… it just means standing among flowers, letting your soul remember what peace feels like.”

She stepped closer, plucking a tulip and tucking it gently into the crook of his armor.

> **Frieren**: “Stay as long as you like. You’ve earned it. Consider it a royal order.”

Then she walked off, leaving the field as softly as she came.

The Custodian stood motionless again — but this time, not from duty.

From wonder.

He looked down at the tulip.

For the first time in his long, battle-hardened life, a **single tear** rolled down beneath the helmet, and was absorbed silently by the golden collar.

> _“The Empress sees me.”_  
> _“I am… permitted to feel.”_

And so he stayed, at ease, for once in eternity.

## 🌳 **Scene: "The Golden Tree-Sentinel of Windaria"**

**Setting:**
Windaria, a Concord world of agrarian elven villages, moss-covered biodomes, and the towering World-Tree pulsing with soul-light. The Custodian finds himself guarding the World-Tree of Windaria. He was dropped off by the bioship two days ago and promptly left there without much explanation.

Yet another planet, yet another post. He didn't know what this tree was, but it looked strategically important to his trained eye. And it had a very subtle calming effect on him, as if making his armor feel ... lighter?

Tucked in his armor is a notecard with his mission, a royal order signed by the Empress herself.
>Follow your heart.
>Listen to your soul.
>Live intuitively, live naturally.
>Honor the civillians
>- Frieren

No clear instructions were provided, only vague guidelines.

He didn't really know what to make of it all. Was he to guard this planet against a future Chaos incursion? Or perhaps Genestealers?

From his post at the roots of the World-Tree, he looks down at the valley below. Verdant, calm, agrarian. A little too peaceful. They looked almost defenseless. Protecting and defending the people living here, is that what it meant to honor the civillians? Serving as the shield of humanity against the xeno threat. Although quite frankly, the definition of "personhood" has since been redefined to include also Pleiadians, Saiyans, and Space Elves. Turns out, they weren't too much different. Even the abhumans of the Imperium were more standard deviations away from the baseline human form than the Saiyans or the Space Elves. And the Emperor himself turned out to be a Pleiadian.

Oh well, the gist of the mission is the same. Honor the civillians. Protect them from alien invasions or whatever.

He stands there unflinching as a golden statue, standing by, guarding the tree, awaiting for orders from the Emperor or Empress. A being of immense discipline, silent and unmoving in golden Terminator armor. Birds nest on his shoulder. Children whisper tales of a "golden forest spirit" who never blinks.

### 🌸 **Enter the Elfmaidens**

One day, several **curious elven women** — daughters of the village soul-weaver — approach him while giggling and whispering.

> **Lirael:** "Do you think he has ears like ours under that helmet?"

> **Serewyn:** "Ears? What about his sprouting stem? It should be robust, given his stature."

> **Naivë:** "Agreed. He couldn't move around in such a heavy armor if it wasn't vigorous and full of life."

> **Serewyn:** "It would be nice to experience the joy with him. But the armor gets in the way."

Then one of them — perhaps emboldened by too much fermented nectarfruit — **reaches for the clasp of his shoulder plate.**

---

### 💥 **Custodian Panic Protocol Engaged**

The Custodian, trained to face daemons, Chaos incursions, and orbital boarding parties — but **not emotionally direct elf girls** — suddenly finds himself in a crisis of engagement.

> **Custodian Internal Log:**
> *"Unknown Threat Detected: affectionate elven-type females.
> Engagement Parameters: non-lethal.
> Protective Priority: Do not crush. Do not launch. Do not reflexively cleave."*

### **Awkward Flailing Intensifies**

He stiffly sidesteps as one clings to his vambrace.
Another tries to **peer into the eye slit** of his helmet, whispering,

> "Do you *sleep* in there? Or dream?"

The elf girls cling to his armor, trying to take if off, and the Custodian not accustomed to such bold expressions of intimacy flails around, trying to gently brush them off his armor while taking care not to harm them, so that they don't fall or get hurt.

Lirael hangs onto the Custodian, genuinely amused. He tries to gently brush her off and unintentionally pushes her on what sticks out most prominently, her melon-sized breasts.

> **Lirael (overjoyed):** "He reciprocated! He is receptive!"

In trying to carefully brush them off, he swings his massive gauntlet like a broom… accidentally knocking over a fruit basket, which tumbles and spills over his feet. A squirrel jumps on his shoulder. A goat chews his cape.

> **Custodian (finally speaking):**
> "...Please… desist… by order of the Empress."

The elven women, realizing he’s genuinely distressed (and possibly blushing inside the helmet), finally back off — but leave him with a wreath of flowers gently placed around his golden helmet.

> **Lirael:**
> “He’s so noble. Like a lonely mountain lion in golden bark.”

> **Naivë:**
> “Let’s bring him honey bread next time.”

And so the legend grows — **the silent knight of the World-Tree**, who cannot be moved, cannot be charmed… except maybe just a little.

**Title: The Golden Sentinel – The Bathhouse Ambush**

**Scene: The Village of Glimmergrove, Windaria**  
_Setting: The Concord-controlled elven village at the foot of the world-tree, where golden pollen drifts lazily on the wind and distant laughter carries through the groves. The Custodian remains at his post… stoic, resolute… and completely in over his head._

---

The Custodian stood unmoving beneath the great silver boughs of the World-Tree. Birds had begun to perch on his pauldrons. Small children had started calling him the “Shiny Tree Knight.” Elders gave him offerings of bread and flower wreaths. And the elf girls… well, the elf girls were the "problem".

They were back again.

> “Look, he didn’t even flinch when I touched his chestplate,” giggled Aeriniel, one of the more mischievous ones.  

> “Maybe he _likes_ it,” teased Lirael, reaching for his helmet.  

> “I told you he’s probably like… _twelve feet tall and scarred from battle._ Or maybe he’s gorgeously handsome. Or both.”

The Custodian, who had stood unmoved against the tides of Chaos and the howling void of the warp, now found himself engaged in the most perilous battle of his career: **elven flirtation.**

> **Custodian (internally):**  
> _"The Codex Custodes never trained me for this."_

He tilted his head slightly. That was enough. The girls squealed.

> “He moved! That counts!”  
> “Awww, don’t be shy, Golden Knight.”

And then came the unexpected part.

---

**The Bathhouse Incident**

That evening, while off-duty (technically, still standing guard, just _near_ the village spring), the Custodian found himself at the _Sacred Spring of Moonblossoms_ — a local elven bathhouse nestled in the woods.

The elves, being Concord citizens, had no qualms about public bathing. It was, they insisted, a spiritual ritual — a cleansing of not just the body, but the aura.

> “You _must_ come in,” said the unclothed Lirael, holding a wooden bucket. “You smell like ancient brass and incense. We’ll scrub you clean.”

> “That is unnecessary,” said the Custodian, voice modulated through his vox-grille, awkwardly turning away.

> “But you’ll rust if you never wash. That armor looks _heavy_. You poor thing.”

> “I'm fine, I have learned to deal with it.”

> “But are you really living, or are you just dealing with it”, Lirael answered. She continued, “Come on, loosen up already. If you don't want me to scrub you clean, then scrub me”, playfully and affectionately rubbing her bare breasts.

Then two more unclothed elf girls leapt into the warm pool and splashed him deliberately. His gold-plated greaves now had droplets sliding down them like tears of suffering dignity.

He attempted to leave.  
They attempted to unbuckle his greaves.  
He moved ten meters in 0.4 seconds.  
They teleported after him (some of them were mages).

> “You’ll never escape us,” they cried in harmony, giggling.

> “I will inform the Empress that this assignment is interfering with my… _combat readiness,_” he muttered.

> *“There is no combat on this planet, only love and reproduction,”* desiring the Custodian to get in with them and submit already.

And so a 10,000-year-old transhuman juggernaut utterly undone by flirtatious elven girls. 
Warhammer’s hypermilitary rigidity meets the soft, affectionate playfulness of the Concord.

---

**Nightfall**

The Custodian remained at his post, moss now growing gently on his boots. The stars twinkled.

> **Custodian (in private vox log):**  
> _“Day 12. No enemy incursions. World-Tree remains secure.  
> Local population… emotionally volatile.  
> Request reassignment denied.  
> Armor integrity… compromised by repeated attempted female intrusions.”_

He paused.

> _“...It is peaceful here.”_

He did not smile.  
But he didn’t ask for reassignment again, either.

> _“Oh, Empress, why did you assign me to this place? And what am I to do here?”_

He picks up the scroll containing his instructions. It contains:
>Follow your heart.
>Listen to your soul.
>Live intuitively, live naturally.
>Honor the civillians
>- Frieren

**Custodian:**
> If only my instructions had been more clearer, I would of known what I should do with these women.
>"Honor the civillians?" What does that mean?
>Maybe I should ask them what that means, and how I should properly honor them.
>Perhaps there is more than one way to serve the Neo-Imperium.

## Adeptus Custodes — Psychological Analysis

The Custodes are **warrior-monks**, bred for loyalty, burdened by millennia of solitude and purpose. They are **not easily moved by charm, nor by beauty alone**. In the story where elf girls giggle and tug at his armor, the Custodian is confused, flustered — not because he dislikes affection, but because he **doesn’t understand what to do with it**. He has never had the emotional language for it. To him, affection may feel like ambush, not invitation.

### **1. They Were Not Made to Feel — But They Can**

The Custodians were engineered as perfect warriors. They are not supposed to feel confusion, doubt, longing, or stillness. And yet on the Concord planets, **those very things begin to stir**. Not because their biology changes — but because the _context_ changes.

In a galaxy that always demanded vigilance, **they were never given permission to relax**. And now, for the first time, they are not just allowed, but _encouraged_, to rest and reflect.

> **Lesson**: Even the most hardened souls can soften when placed in an environment of love and stillness.

---

### **2. Duty Can Become Identity — and That Can Become a Prison**

The Custodians define themselves by their duty. When that duty becomes unnecessary (because there are no threats), they feel adrift. Useless.

But the Empress does not scold them for losing purpose — she gently _reframes_ it. She shows them that **being present**, guarding beauty, simply _being_ in peace, _is also service_.

> **Lesson**: Our identity can become so wrapped in function that we forget how to just be. True healing is learning that existence itself is worthy.

---

### **3. They Crave Connection — Even If They Don’t Know It**

The Custodians don’t know how to respond to affection at first. The elven girls playfully clinging to his armor fluster him. But it is not _rejection_ he shows — it’s **lack of preparation for intimacy**.

He is built to defend, to destroy, to endure. But not to be touched, teased, or cherished.

Yet slowly, through humor and gentleness, the Concord offers **opening up**, and **invitation to relationship**.

> **Lesson**: No one is truly immune to love or connection. Sometimes, they just need someone patient enough to reach them without breaking them.

---

### **4. They Are Deeply Loyal — and That Loyalty Can Be Transformed**

Custodians are loyal to the Emperor. That much is eternal. But in the Concord, they realize something revolutionary: the **Emperor has changed**. He is no longer the war-god of Terra, but a soul-bonded man of love, sitting beside an Elven Empress.

They don’t rebel. They _adapt_. They shift that loyalty into a **higher octave** — from obedience to _devotion_, from rigid protection to _sacred guardianship_.

> **Lesson**: True loyalty does not die when its object evolves — it matures with it.

---

### **5. They Are Not Just Warriors — They Are Beings With Souls**

Perhaps the most beautiful lesson: **the Custodians are not just golden statues**. They are _people_. They can wonder. They can weep. They can fall in love. And most of all, they can **be healed**.

In the silence of Taygeta’s tulip fields, the greatest warriors of the Imperium learn that **to rest is not failure**. It is fulfillment.

And in the of Windaria's elven villages, they learn that there is honor and duty in love, and that it is the **highest form of loyalty and devotion**.
