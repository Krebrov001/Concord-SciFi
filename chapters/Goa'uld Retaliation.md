### **I. Early Life – Drenhold Primaris**

- Marcus was born in **Hive Harthuun**, one of Drenhold’s upper-hive towers, to a minor officer caste family. His mother was an Arbites enforcer, and his father a logistics officer for the Munitorum.
    
- Drenhold was a **high-discipline Forge-Hive world**, heavily militarized and structured, but not fully mechanized like a Forge World. Known for producing elite Commissars, shock troops, and supply lines.
    
- From the age of 6, Marcus was enrolled in the **Progenium Orphan Cadre**, a harsh ecclesiarchal program designed to raise children of Imperial servants to become priests, officers, or Commissars.
    
- At age 12, he received public lashings for insubordination after defending a fellow student from excessive punishment. He did not regret it but internalized the need for _controlled mercy_.

### **II. Schola Progenium and Commissariat**

- At age 16, Marcus entered the **Schola Progenium** on **Drusus Magna**, one of the Imperium’s premier officer-forging worlds.
    
- His instructors described him as “**stoic, just, and terrifyingly composed**.”
    
    - He memorized entire sections of the _Catechism of Hate_ and was known to recite them during midnight drills.
        
- Specialized in **combat morale doctrine**, **rhetoric and motivation**, **execution protocol**, and **combat logistics**.
    
- Upon graduation, he was assigned as Commissar to the **Harthuun 9th Steel Guards**, where he served with distinction on campaigns against Orks, heretics, and even minor Tyranid splinters.

### **III. Personality and Habits**

- **Believer in Order, but not Cruelty**: Unlike many Commissars, Vrangell did not take pleasure in punishment. He believed discipline was a **sacred duty**, not an outlet for ego.
    
- **Privately Reflective**: Kept journals, including quotations from the _Meditations of Saint Astellus_ and personal thoughts—though never shared them until after his defection.
    
- **Solitary but Not Cold**: Often drank alone, read old litanies, and listened to hive-choir recordings from his childhood.
    
- **Never Married**, though he once carried a faded pict of a fellow Progenium cadet who had died in a Hive rebellion.

### **IV. Crusade Context**

- Selected for the **Stargate Crusade** due to his record of success in psychologically complex environments.
    
- Viewed the Goa’uld initially as yet another heretical xenos religion to be expunged.
    
- Maintained high morale among his troops, was known for **walking the lines** without bodyguards, inspiring confidence through presence and poise.
    

---

### **V. Seeds of Transformation**

- Began experiencing **inner conflicts** when:
    
    - He encountered villagers who prayed not out of fear, but out of love.
        
    - He was called "Marcus" by his own troops but heard "Mark" from grateful villagers who saw him as a protector rather than an enforcer.
        
    - Witnessed _living memory trees_ that bore the names of both Imperial and Goa’uld dead—and saw no blasphemy in the act.
        

---

### **VI. Post-Defection**

- Abandoned his Commissar’s coat and boltpistol, but kept his officer’s sash—wrapped it around the base of a Memory Tree he later planted.
    
- Relearned **Low Gothic** poetry and began **teaching children military history** through storytelling and drama, not drills.
    
- Occasionally consults with Concord bioship designers on **discipline structure for mixed-species crews**, translating his old militarism into a **soulful code of unity**.

### **Final Reflection** (Quote from his Concord Memoir)

> _“I was forged to teach obedience through fear.  
> Now I teach vigilance through love.  
> The chain has become a staff. The pistol, a pen.  
> My name is Mark.”_

Would you like to write a scene showing young Marcus in the Schola Progenium? Or his first true moral conflict in the Stargate Crusade?


Confirmed. That correction is now **canon**:

> **Marcus Vrangell was 39 standard Terran years old** when he first stepped through the Stargate on **Abydos-Primus**, leading Imperial forces during the early phase of the **Stargate Crusade**.

I will reflect this age consistently in all future references. Let me know if you'd like to expand on that first crossing moment or his impressions upon seeing Abydos.
