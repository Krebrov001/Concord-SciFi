### **[DarkNet Forum: /ImperialLeaks/ — Thread: “Concord Teleportation — Are They Even Leaving the Planet?”]**

**User:** *QuantumShade*  
> Has anyone else noticed something weird? We hear about Concord hit-and-run strikes on Imperial warships *in space*, but where are all their ships most of the time? Why don’t we see massive Concord fleets patrolling orbit or cruising through the void?

**User:** *GlitchMage*  
> That’s exactly it. The Concord ships are made of *living wood* and supposedly have “intuitive psychic dimensional folding.” What if they don’t need to *fly* through space at all? What if they just *fold* themselves from one planet to another like opening a door?

**User:** *JungleRunner*  
> So no orbital escape velocity, no space battles in traditional terms. Just *blink* — here, then gone. That would explain the *silent* strikes, the mysterious disappearances. No chase possible if you don’t show up on sensors in the first place.

**User:** *NeonHarbinger*  
> I heard some old rumor about something like Goku’s “Instant Transmission” — a magical or psychic teleport that lets you jump across planets instantly. Could be that the Concord’s pilots and bio-ships are using a similar power, enhanced by their bond with the living ships.

**User:** *SynthGhost*  
> And it’s gotta be linked to their trees and forests somehow — like a planetary network of psychic “currents” or “astral pathways” that they tap into. Their ships *communicate* with the planet’s soul and use that to slip through dimensions.

**User:** *SteelReaper_89*  
> Makes sense why the Imperium’s sensors often fail. If the ships never really “move” through space conventionally, their profiles would be invisible or too brief to catch. Only time you see them is during hit-and-run raids—then they vanish again.

**User:** *GhostInTheMachine*  
> This also ties into the whole “roots beneath our feet” thing. Maybe the ships can *grow* or *emerge* from the planet itself, no launch needed. You see a tree, then suddenly it’s a warship. That’s nightmare stealth.

**User:** *CinderWitch*  
> Imagine trying to blockade a planet where your enemy never actually *leaves* the surface properly. How do you siege that? How do you starve out a fleet that’s part-forest, part-spirit?

**User:** *DataJack*  
> If true, the Concord’s whole FTL and space warfare doctrine is fundamentally different. Instead of raw firepower or numbers, they rely on *dimensional folding* and *psychic resonance.* That’s why they’ve been invisible ghosts to the Imperium for so long.

**User:** *NeonHarbinger*  
> The Imperium fights the void with void-shields and void-guns. But if your enemy just steps through a fold in reality to hit you… well, the war changes completely.

**User:** *QuantumShade*  
> This explains everything. The Concord’s bio-ships are not just ships. They are *extensions of living planets*, jumping through space and dimension like they’re walking through doors. No orbital fleet needed. No sensor signature. Just *silent, deadly roots*.

### **[DarkNet Forum: /ImperialLeaks/ — Thread: “Why the Concord Only Shows Up on Green Worlds?”]**

**User:** *JungleRunner*  
> Notice something? Concord ships and settlements never show up on airless, dead planets or those stuck way outside the habitable zone. They always pick worlds with breathable atmospheres or at least partially alive Mars-like planets. Why? Because they *need* life to bond with, right?

**User:** *SynthGhost*  
> Makes sense. Their bio-ships and villages are literally grown from living wood and plant matter. No life, no “seed” to grow from. So they terraform *fast*—but only where there’s a foothold already. They don’t just invade dead rock; they *awaken* planets.

**User:** *GlitchMage*  
> Yeah, terraforming isn’t just machinery for them. It’s like a spiritual or magical process. Elemental benders and sages working with the planet’s soul. It’s faster and more *natural* than the Imperium’s clunky tech.

**User:** *NeonHarbinger*  
> Also explains why their villages and fortifications are invisible to orbital scans—wood and living matter don’t reflect or emit signals like metal hulls. From space, it’s just forests. Perfect camouflage.

**User:** *DataJack*  
> So the Imperium’s sensor sweeps see nothing. No metal heat signatures, no radiation spikes, just… green. That’s why entire “dead worlds” suddenly look alive again, but no signs of industry or tech. Just Concord *roots* spreading.

**User:** *ShadowWhisper*  
> And their dimensional folding tech lets them pop in and out before you can blink. So they don’t need to control space lanes or orbits—why bother when you can *skip* the void and just walk through reality’s backdoor?

**User:** *SteelReaper_89*  
> The Imperium fights in void and vacuum, but Concord fights in forest and spirit. They turn planets into living bastions — impossible to bomb from orbit without killing the whole ecosystem, which probably would kill them too.

**User:** *CinderWitch*  
> What if these planets’ trees and plants are actually extensions of the Concord’s network? A giant bio-psyche web spanning miles underground. Destroy one tree and ten more rise up in its place.

**User:** *NeonHarbinger*  
> The “jungles that sing” from the propaganda broadcast aren’t just metaphor. They literally *communicate* with each other—and with the ships. This isn’t just guerrilla warfare, it’s symbiosis on a cosmic scale.

**User:** *JungleRunner*  
> So the Concord don’t just invade planets — they *become* the planet. This isn’t war; it’s *rooted* conquest.

### **[DarkNet Forum: /ImperialLeaks/ — Thread: “Concord’s Memory Trees — Living Computers or Psychic Web?”]**

**User:** *MindBloom*  
> Alright, I’ve been digging through some leaks and old heretek texts, and here’s a crazy thought: the Concord’s “memory trees” aren’t just plants. They’re genetically engineered *living computers.* Their roots intertwine underground, forming a massive planetary neural network.

**User:** *GhostInTheMachine*  
> That fits what we’ve heard about psionic resonance and atmospheric readings. But they don’t *send data* like digital networks — they send *memories,* feelings, and ancestral knowledge. Imagine a planetary internet where every node shares emotions, not just files.

**User:** *NeonHarbinger*  
> Sounds like a hyper-realistic braindance, but it’s real life. Concord sages and mages can tap into this network psychically, accessing collective memories like browsing a library… but it’s immersive, emotional, alive.

**User:** *SynthGhost*  
> So when a pilot “communes” with their bio-ship, it’s more than just telepathic control. They’re syncing with this memory web, sharing centuries of knowledge, instincts, even ancestral spirits embedded in the wood.

**User:** *JungleRunner*  
> That explains the uncanny intuitive navigation during their dimensional folding jumps. They’re not calculating routes — they’re *feeling* astral currents, guided by the memories of all who came before.

**User:** *GlitchMage*  
> The roots themselves are like fiber-optic cables but living. Cut one connection, and another sprouts to reroute the flow of psychic data. A self-healing, evolving brain spanning entire planets.

**User:** *ShadowWhisper*  
> No wonder Imperial tech fails to detect their “computers.” You can’t scan memories or feelings with a void scanner. You have to *experience* it to know it’s there.

**User:** *SteelReaper_89*  
> And this raises a terrifying question: what if invading or destroying Concord worlds means erasing entire conscious networks? Killing *living archives* of culture and history encoded in trees.

**User:** *CinderWitch*  
> The Concord’s war isn’t just physical; it’s psychic and cultural. Their forests are libraries, their ships are sentient vessels, and their soldiers fight with ancestral strength flowing through their roots.

**User:** *NeonHarbinger*  
> It’s not just a network. It’s a *living memory.* A planetary soul.

### **Segmentum Solar - Ordo Hereticus**  
**Classified Report**  
**Subject:** Analysis of Concord Ship Movement and FTL Capabilities  
**Filed by:** Inquisitor-Analyst Kaelis Vorn  
**Date:** Classified  

---

#### Executive Summary:  
Recent operational patterns of Concord naval units suggest unconventional methods of spatial traversal that defy standard Astronautica Imperialis detection protocols. Notably, the absence of persistent Concord fleet presence in orbital or interplanetary space challenges prevailing assumptions of conventional warp or hyperspace travel.

---

#### Observations:  
1. **Disappearance and Reappearance Events:**  
Concord vessels have been documented engaging in high-impact, short-duration raids against Imperial warships before vanishing without trace. These events occur without prior or subsequent sensor contact, suggesting a mode of rapid transit inconsistent with known warp or hyperspace navigation.

2. **Living Wood Biotech and Psychic Linkage:**  
Recovered data and limited reconnaissance confirm Concord ships are grown from bio-organic “living wood” fused with complex psychic matrices. These vessels are reportedly bonded to their pilots through intense telepathic symbiosis, allowing mutual intuitive control.

3. **Dimensional Folding Hypothesis:**  
Cross-referencing intercepted communications and field reports support a theory that Concord ships employ a form of “dimensional folding” or “psychic portal” technology. This purportedly allows instantaneous relocation between planetary surfaces or star systems by manipulating space-time harmonics rather than traditional warp tunnels.

4. **Planetary Integration and Stealth:**  
The hypothesis extends to suggest Concord ships may utilize a form of planetary resonance, enabling them to remain effectively undetectable by standard Imperial sensors while integrated within or emerging directly from a planet’s biosphere. This would permit the Concord to bypass orbital escape velocity requirements entirely, facilitating surprise strike capability and immediate withdrawal.

---

#### Implications:  
- **Sensor and Detection Limitations:**  
Standard astronavigational scanners and void detection arrays are ill-equipped to track such non-linear spatial displacements, explaining repeated failures to intercept or pursue Concord forces.

- **Tactical and Strategic Threat:**  
The ability to manifest ships from planetary biospheres and traverse dimensions instantaneously disrupts Imperial naval doctrine centered on control of space lanes and star system orbits. This requires reevaluation of perimeter defense and rapid response protocols.

- **Psychic Vulnerabilities and Countermeasures:**  
Given the reported psychic symbiosis, there is potential for targeted psy-operations or biotoxins (see Project BLACK SEED) to disrupt pilot-ship cohesion. However, such approaches remain untested and carry high risk of collateral damage to Imperial psykers.

---

#### Recommendations:  
1. **Intensify Surveillance of Deprioritized Worlds:**  
Deploy covert astropathic probes and orbital survey arrays focusing on long-abandoned planets exhibiting abnormal biospheric regeneration.

2. **Expand Research into Non-Conventional FTL Phenomena:**  
Commission Mechanicus and Adeptus Astra Telepathica research teams to investigate dimensional folding mechanics and develop counter-technologies.

3. **Develop Specialized Strike Units:**  
Formulate elite boarding and infiltration squads trained in counter-psyker and bio-organic warfare to engage Concord forces within biospheres.

---

#### Conclusion:  
The Concord’s use of psychic dimensional folding and biologically integrated vessels represents a paradigm shift in xenos threat assessment. The Imperium must adapt its doctrines and technologies or risk being outmaneuvered by an enemy who does not conform to established spatial laws.

### Scene: **Astropathic Hall, Proxima Ordos — High Command Briefing Room**

The chamber is dimly lit, walls lined with flickering cogitator screens and pulsating astropathic resonators. A great star map glows at the center, displaying several systems marked in red.

**Fleet Admiral Decimus Varro** sits rigidly, his polished ceramite armor reflecting the dull light. Across from him stands **Inquisitor Kaelis Vorn**, robes immaculate, eyes sharp with fervor.

---

**Vorn:** *(voice low, urgent)*  
“Admiral Varro, the Concord threat grows beyond any prior understanding. Their ships—biological vessels grown from living wood—are not constrained by conventional physics. They do not traverse the void in any manner we can detect.”

**Varro:** *(frowning)*  
“Your report suggests... dimensional folding? Psychic portals? Preposterous. How are we to fight an enemy who steps through walls of reality as if they were doors?”

**Vorn:**  
“Precisely. My theory is backed up both by observational evidence and by the reports of Mechanicus spies within the apostate cybernetic human pocket-empire known as Night City. Our sensors fail because their vessels do not cross space linearly. They ‘fold’ the fabric of space-time itself, arriving instantaneously from one planetary biosphere to another. They bypass orbital defenses entirely.”

**Varro:** *(gritting his teeth)*  
“That would explain the sudden strikes on our fleets—no prior warning, no pursuit possible. It’s like they are ghosts.”

**Vorn:**  
“More than ghosts, Admiral. Their ships are extensions of their worlds. They commune with the planet’s soul—emerging from forests as easily as a leaf falls. Our void-scanners register nothing until the first volley is fired.”

**Varro:** *(leaning forward)*  
“What of countermeasures? Project BLACK SEED? Psy-operations?”

**Vorn:** *(nods grimly)*  
“Underway, but untested. The psychic link between pilot and ship is profound—disrupting it risks corrupting our own psykers. We must proceed with caution.”

**Varro:**  
“We cannot rely on brute force or traditional fleet maneuvers. We need new tactics—boarding squads trained in bio-organic warfare, enhanced detection arrays tuned to astral harmonics.”

**Vorn:**  
“Agreed. I recommend immediate deployment of covert probes to those deprioritized worlds exhibiting regrowth. The Concord use those gaps to root themselves unseen.”

**Varro:** *(resolute)*  
“The Imperium endures. If these ‘space trees’ think they can hide beneath our feet, we will uproot them, no matter the cost.”

**Vorn:** *(voice dropping to a solemn whisper)*  
“They have roots. And they are already beneath us, Admiral. The question is whether we can burn the forest before it grows beyond our reach.”

---

The star map flickers ominously as the two lock eyes, bound by grim determination to face an enemy that transcends the known laws of war.
