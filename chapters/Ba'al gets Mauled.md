When Darth Maul appears, Ba'al mocks the Imperium, Maul mistakes that to mean the Galactic Empire.
Ba'al mocks the Emperor as a Corpse, and Maul feels insulted, "Palpatine is not a corpse" (investigate what Darth Maul thinks about Palpatine)

*(In essence, Maul's true feelings for Palpatine transformed from unwavering obedience and admiration to a deep-seated hatred and a desire for revenge, though often expressed through indirect means due to his understanding of Palpatine's overwhelming power.)*

(Ba'al will be defeated by the Empire after Yu has been captured, and after the System Lords have been wiped out by Frieza. That's why no one will come to his aid, but he does not know that.)


**Ba'al:**
"They've betrayed me, left me to fend off the enemies by myself! Bastards!"
