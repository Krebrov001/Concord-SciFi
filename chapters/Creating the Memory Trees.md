The **Deepwood Pulse** is one of the most profound metaphysical phenomena in the _Concord Saga_. It is both a biological and spiritual infrastructure that runs through the ancient **world-trees** and **memory-trees** planted across Concord worlds. Here's a detailed explanation of its nature and function:

---

### 🌿 **Definition:**

The **Deepwood Pulse** is a _biospiritual resonance network_—a planetary and interplanetary system of communication, memory, and soul-interchange. It moves not through cables or signals, but through **living roots**, **spiritual vibration**, and **emotional memory**.

### 🧠 **Structure:**

1. **🌳 World-Tree Root Systems**
    
    - Enormous subterranean root networks stretch across continents and even into the crust of planets. These roots carry more than water and nutrients—they transmit _soul-resonant information_.
        
    - This is not data in a digital sense, but **feeling, memory, longing, and wisdom** encoded in biological rhythm.
        
2. **🌱 Memory Trees**
    
    - Grown by Elven bio-mages and Pleiadian soul-gardeners, these trees act as **local memory servers**, interpreting the Pulse and storing individual and collective memories.
        
    - Some are grown over ruins of ancient cities, absorbing and healing generational trauma.
        
3. **🧬 Soul Mycelium**
    
    - Microscopic fungi-like strands connect tree roots across different species and regions. These act as the **emotional routing layer**, determining where memories and resonances flow.
        
    - It’s through this mycelial soul-web that empathic messages can reach other villages—or even other planets—through synchronized groves and rituals.

### 🕊️ **Function:**

- **Reincarnation Pathway:**  
    When Concord citizens die, their souls may reincarnate through the Deepwood Pulse—drawn back by **resonance** to places or people they love.
    
- **Planetary Healing:**  
    The Pulse carries sorrow, trauma, and love—transmuting them into _soul-compost_. It allows _shared healing_ across villages and continents.
    
- **SoulNet Equivalent:**  
    This is the Concord's alternative to digital networks like the Mechanicus noosphere or the Federation's computers. Instead of servers and signals, the Pulse transmits through _ritual, meditation, and harmonic alignment_.
    
- **Remote View Support:**  
    Ashtar Sheran often uses the Pulse as a "carrier wave" during his **remote viewing** meditations, especially when connecting with lost souls or distant Concord outposts.

### 🔮 **Symbolism and Philosophy:**

- The Pulse teaches that **life and memory are not linear**, but circular and harmonic.
    
- It reflects the Concord's principle that **information should not be extracted or controlled**, but grown, shared, and felt.
    
- The more love and stillness you radiate, the more attuned you become to the Pulse.

### 📜 In the Words of Velarion:

> “The Pulse does not shout. It hums. It waits for you to remember—not with your mind, but with your soul. Only then do the trees speak.”

Would you like a visual map of the Deepwood Pulse network? Or a scene of someone accessing it—perhaps a Night City exile hearing the trees speak for the first time?
