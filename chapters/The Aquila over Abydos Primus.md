# The Aquila over Abydos Primus

Below is the **briefing scene** back at *Fort Sanctus Veritus*, where Commissar Mark (Marcus) Vrangell formally reports to the planetary governor and naval high command. This moment showcases the Imperium's bureaucratic machine absorbing the Stargate discovery, cloaked in optimism and imperial certainty‚Äîwhile unknowingly setting up their first true entanglement with the Goa‚Äôuld.

## üìú **Imperial Briefing: The World Beyond the Gate**

**Location:** Command Sanctum, *Fort Sanctus Veritus*
**Attendees:**

* **Commissar Mark Vrangell**, Expedition Leader
* **Governor Elric Vann-Holt**, Planetary Administrator of Veritus Prime
* **Admiral Lucerne Brax**, Battlefleet Solar, Ordo Subsectoris Navis Imperialis
* Mechanicus liaison: *Enginseer Prime Valexa Tor* (representing Magos Rhox)
* Various scribes, lexmechanics, and vox-aides recording the session in real time

---

The **command sanctum** is a stone-vaulted chamber reinforced with ceramite ribs and Aquila banners. Auspex scrolls line the walls. The air smells of incense and data-ink.

Commissar Vrangell stands stiffly at the head of the briefing table, his gloved hands resting on a slate projector. Behind him, a **hololith** flickers to life‚Äîdisplaying images of a **massive desert pyramid**, primitive settlements, and **schematics of mineral veins**.

> **VRANGELL (in formal cadence):**
> ‚ÄúBy decree of the God-Emperor, I present this report concerning the extragalactic gate mechanism recovered in the Stone Hollow of Veritus Prime, now designated *Artifact V-Null-0.*‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThrough it, our forces traversed without warp translation or Gellar field shielding, arriving near-instantaneously upon a stable planetary surface. The world beyond‚Äîhereafter designated *Abydos Primus* pending full classification‚Äîis barren in climate, dominated by desert topography, and marked by Early Imperium Revivalist architecture.‚Äù

> *\[Gestures to the hololith image of the pyramid]*
> ‚ÄúA massive tetrahedral structure houses the gate device. Internal corridors are structurally sound, engraved in hieroglyphic script, and emit low-level residual energy. Outside, adobe-style settlements exist, low technology, no known voidcraft.‚Äù

> **GOVERNOR VANN-HOLT (leaning forward eagerly):**
> ‚ÄúAnd the locals? Resistant?‚Äù

> **VRANGELL:**
> ‚ÄúNot in the slightest, Lord Governor. They speak Low Gothic‚Äîarchaic, but functional.
> Behaviorally compliant. No signs of rebellion, mutation, or heretical creed.
> They appear to mistake us for emissaries of a different god-ruler, but accepted Imperial reintegration with minimal clarification.‚Äù

> **ADMR. BRAX (sternly):**
> ‚ÄúAny sign of xeno occupation, rival banners, fortifications?‚Äù

> **VRANGELL:**
> ‚ÄúNone at this time. Local myths refer vaguely to ‚Äògods who rule from the stars,‚Äô but we suspect these are residual cultural impressions from ancient contact‚Äîpossibly during the Great Crusade or even pre-Unity human diaspora.‚Äù

> **ENGINSEER TOR:**
> *‚ÄúChemical soil analyses suggest long-term stability. This ‚ÄòAbydos‚Äô bears no warp taint. However‚Äî‚Äù*
> *\[She taps her data-scroll]*
> ‚Äú‚Äîwe have confirmed the presence of an exotic mineral used extensively in their tools and ornaments. The locals call it *Naquadah*. Preliminary tests indicate it holds tremendous density, energy conductivity, and modulation potential.‚Äù

> **VRANGELL:**
> ‚ÄúCorrect. It could rival plasteel in structure and plasma coils in versatility. The Mechanicus is eager to begin extraction and sanctified study.‚Äù

> **GOVERNOR VANN-HOLT (grinning):**
> ‚ÄúThen this‚Ä¶ this is *Providence*! A compliant lost world, with ancient archeo-tech, valuable resources, and no standing opposition? I can already hear the Munitorum scribes sharpening their quills. We‚Äôll classify it a **Mining World** immediately, begin export quotas. Make sure they inscribe *my* name into the registry, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù

> **VRANGELL (bowing slightly):**
> ‚ÄúAlready done, Lord Governor.‚Äù

> **ADMR. BRAX:**
> ‚ÄúWhat of the gate itself? Security status?‚Äù

> **VRANGELL:**
> ‚ÄúA full detachment of Krieg and Vostroyan regiments now garrison the pyramid. No anomalies observed since the initial traversal. Magos Rhox has begun constructing a fortified chamber around the gate mouth. All entries and exits are tracked and recorded. No activity from the other side. Yet.‚Äù

> **GOVERNOR VANN-HOLT:**
> *‚ÄúThen congratulations, gentlemen. This may be the most fortunate event in Veritus Prime‚Äôs recorded history.
> Our planet is now the *gateway* to an ancient corridor of human expansion‚Ä¶ or perhaps more.‚Äù*

> **ENGINSEER TOR:**
> *‚ÄúPraise the Omnissiah.‚Äù*

> **VRANGELL:**
> ‚ÄúAnd the Emperor. Always.‚Äù

---

As the **briefing concludes**, scribes begin transcribing the event into the official **Segmentum archives**. Outside, construction begins on **Landing Pad Tertius**, meant to ferry Mechanicus mining drills and resource haulers through the gate. The great gears of the Imperium begin to churn‚Äîslow, proud, and blind.

No one yet suspects what truly sleeps beneath the sand.

---

Here's the **next scene**, a formal moment of quiet pride within the Imperium's inner sanctum‚Äîwhere ancient men and women atop Terra, far removed from the frontline reality, observe the Abydos expedition with cold satisfaction and blind trust in the Imperium's inevitability.

---

## üèõÔ∏è **Imperial Judgement: The High Lords of Terra**

**Location:** The Eternity Gate, Terra
**Chamber:** Strategium Sanctum, Imperial Palace
**Security Clearance:** Omega Primaris
**Attendees:**

* **High Lord Admiral Semion Benthos** (Representative of the Navis Imperialis)
* **Cardinal Vor Lasken** (Ecclesiarchal Seat)
* **Fabricator-General Varlax Theta-9** (Adeptus Mechanicus) via holoprojection
* **Lord Confessor Halbrant Zho**
* **Master of the Administratum, Lady Halica Terann**
* **Other voting members of the Senatorum Imperialis**
* **Servo-scribes**, **data-cherubs**, and **one mute Astropath** watching from shadowed alcoves

---

The **Strategium Sanctum** is a towering, star-lit chamber, its arched windows gazing down upon the black oceans of Terra. Massive incense burners waft sacred smoke, while golden aquilae look down in eternal judgement. The air vibrates with encrypted vox-cant as a **holo-simulacra** replays Vrangell‚Äôs full briefing before the council.

**Hololithic stills** of the pyramid, the desert settlement, and the symbol-laden gate float mid-air, flickering subtly. Scribes take notes in triple redundancy, scratching onto parchment and into data-slates simultaneously.

As the final words of Vrangell‚Äôs report echo into silence, a slow murmur begins.

> **LADY TERANN (dryly):**
> ‚ÄúA compliant world with mineral wealth and no resistance.
> Blessed be the Emperor‚Äôs hand. Efficient, bloodless compliance‚Äîwhat a novelty.‚Äù

> **CARDINAL LASKEN:**
> *\[Nods approvingly]*
> ‚ÄúA world that still speaks Low Gothic. Clearly, the Emperor‚Äôs light never fully left it.
> Let this be read aloud in the next Ecclesiarchal sermon: *‚ÄòEven the forgotten shall remember Him.‚Äô*‚Äù

> **FABRICATOR-GENERAL VARLAX (distorted vox):**
> ‚ÄúThe discovery of Naquadah is of supreme interest.
> The potential application to voidcraft armor, plasma refinement, and macrocoil batteries is‚Ä¶ vast.
> Full STC mapping rights are hereby requested under Treaty clause seventeen-point-nine.‚Äù

> **HIGH LORD ADMIRAL BENTHOS:**
> *\[Leaning back in his golden throne]*
> ‚ÄúYes, yes. But let us not mistake fortune for invulnerability.
> A stable gate of unknown reach has been uncovered.
> Others may soon discover it‚Äîxenos, pirates, or worse.‚Äù
> *\[Turns to a holomap projection of Segmentum Obscurus]*
> ‚ÄúDispatch *Vigilant Sky*, Frigate-Class. Minimal crew. Warp transit.
> Chart course to Abydos Primus through Sector Kallidor routes.
> Should arrive within‚Ä¶ two Terran years, barring warp tides.‚Äù

> **LORD CONFESSOR ZHO:**
> *‚ÄúAnd if the system is compromised by the time they arrive?‚Äù*

> **BENTHOS:**
> *‚ÄúThen it will be a recovery mission, not a patrol.
> But either way, we will own that gate. No enemy shall steal the Emperor‚Äôs legacy.‚Äù*

> **ALL:**
> *‚ÄúBy His Will.‚Äù*

---

**Decree issued:**

* **Abydos Primus** is to be formally listed in the Segmentum Obscurus planetary register.
* **Veritus Prime** is granted supervisory rights as the gate-holding world.
* **The Mechanicus** are granted excavation rights.
* **Navis Imperialis** to dispatch **Vigilant Sky** as a monitoring force.
* Ecclesiarchy rites to be prepared for planetary conversion festivals.

## üèõÔ∏è **Abydos, Six Months After First Contact**

### **Planetary Overview**

The sun still blazes mercilessly over the dunes of Abydos, but the Imperium has imposed **order upon heat**.

The **pyramid complex** that once stood in lonely isolation has been transformed into **Fort Triumphis**, a hybrid fortress-cathedral with mechanized parapets, auspex towers, and stained-glass depictions of the Emperor‚Äôs Triumph over Ignorance. The stargate chamber, deep within the pyramid‚Äôs belly, is now a sealed **Mechanicus sanctum**, watched by gun-servitors, psi-hounds, and a rotating platoon of Kriegers.

The **village where first contact occurred** is now the **Provincial Capital of Sector Rho**, complete with ferrocrete roads, an Administratum census office, and a vox-pylon tower playing Liturgies of Compliance across the desert.

What were once adobe homes are now **prefabricated hab-mods**, shipped through the gate in sections, reassembled by servitors and labor crews. The locals marvel at running water, lumen-strips, and ration-grade protein cubes.

> **COMISSAR VRANGELL (in public address):**
> *‚ÄúBehold! The Emperor‚Äôs light made manifest! For you were lost, and now are found.
> You were dust, and now shall be men.‚Äù*

### üèóÔ∏è **Naquadah Mining Operations**

Several miles north of Fort Triumphis, beneath the towering moons of Abydos, stands the **first Mechanicus strip-mining complex**: *Site Omicron-Phi*. Endless **servo-haulers**, **drill-thumpers**, and **ore-walkers** move in choreographed order, extracting **Naquadah** by the ton.

The mineral, once a ceremonial metal for the locals, is now processed into **crates bound for Veritus Prime**, where Tech-Priests dream of its use in experimental plasma accelerators.

> **MAGOS RHOX (via vox):**
> *‚ÄúThe Omnissiah‚Äôs bounty is abundant. This site may surpass Trisolium IX within the decade.‚Äù*

### üß† **Religious Indoctrination**

The **Ecclesiarchy Mission of Saint Alaric the Binder** has established shrines in every village, replacing the old idols and myths of the ‚Äúsky gods‚Äù with statues of the Emperor in radiant bronze. **Preachers, confessors, and Redemptionist choirs** circulate constantly.

Local festivals now celebrate *Reclamation Day*, where children dress as Vostroyan Guardsmen and recite oaths of loyalty to the Imperium. Heretical texts‚Äîany mention of ‚ÄúRa‚Äù or ‚ÄúSystem Lords‚Äù‚Äîare purged, declared myths of ‚ÄúOld Night.‚Äù

> **CARDINAL-ADJUNCT VALKO:**
> *‚ÄúThis world‚Äôs soul was empty, but now it echoes with hymn and fire. We build not only cities, but conviction.‚Äù*

### üëë **Governance and Administration**

**Lucan Dal Forrix**, newly minted planetary governor, has set up residence in a refurbished villa atop a former Goa‚Äôuld stronghold. He oversees local affairs with pomp and a parade of underlings. His **personal coat-of-arms** now bears the aquila atop a pyramid, encircled by the motto: *‚ÄúLux Sine Fine‚Äù ‚Äî Light Without End.*

> **FORRIX (to Governor Vann-Holt via vox):**
> *‚ÄúCompliance exceeds expectations. Even the tax records are shockingly legible.
> Either they were proto-Administratum, or exceptionally terrified. Either way, delightful.‚Äù*

### ü´° **Commissar Vrangell‚Äôs Triumph**

Mark Vrangell walks with a new stiffness in his back‚Äînot from age, but from **promotions and praise**.

He has been **decorated by Segmentum Command**, commended for ‚ÄúExemplary Compliance Through Discipline, Faith, and Decisive Action.‚Äù His name now circulates within the **upper echelons of the Officio Prefectus**. His portrait hangs in the training barracks on Veritus Prime, beneath the words:

> *‚ÄúLet no world fall from Light while one soul still remembers Duty.‚Äù*

He has received **congratulatory missives** from Lord Militant commanders and distant planetary governors. Some whisper his name for future crusade commands. Vrangell, though still stern, allows himself a moment of quiet satisfaction.

> **VRANGELL (in personal log):**
> *‚ÄúI came to Abydos with a platoon and a bolt pistol.
> I leave behind an Imperial world reborn. Praise be.‚Äù*

---

### ‚õèÔ∏è **Beneath the Surface...**

And yet, deep beneath the sand, **hidden vaults remain unopened**.
The Goa‚Äôuld do not forget.
And **not all Abydans believe the stars have changed**.

But for now‚Äî*on the surface*‚Äîthe Imperium sleeps soundly, dreaming of a new world, newly claimed.

---

## üåå **Arrival of the God-King**

#### Location: Low Orbit, Abydos
#### Vessel: _Divine Light of Ra‚Äôs Wrath_
#### Class: Goa‚Äôuld Ha‚Äôtak Mothership
#### Commander: **System Lord Khensu**

Khensu, self-proclaimed _Voice of Ra_, _Breaker of Sutekh_, and Lord of Thirty Worlds, stood upon the obsidian dais at the heart of his throne chamber. The golden serpent circlet upon his brow glinted in the light of the Abydos sun. His eyes, unblinking, watched the **orbital projection of Abydos** with a placid expression‚Äîat first.

Then the flickering holo-image sharpened.

**What he saw was wrong.**

Where once had stood **open sands and sacred glyphs**, there now lay angular ferrocrete **hab-blocks**, **Imperial roadways**, **plasteel guard towers**, and most offensive of all‚Äî**a great shining cathedral** atop his pyramid.

> **KHENSU (voice low, dangerous):**  
> ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ is this desecration?‚Äù

He walked slowly toward the image. In the background, his First Prime said nothing. The ship‚Äôs _pel‚Äôtak_ crew remained rigid, sensing the turbulence beneath their god‚Äôs silence.

Khensu‚Äôs brow twitched as he zoomed in on one image: a statue of a figure clad in armor, **arms spread wide, wreathed in golden light**, standing atop a double-headed eagle.

He recognized no such god.

> **KHENSU:**  
> ‚ÄúWhere are my banners? Where is my face on the temple walls? Where are the slaves preparing the Naquadah tithe?‚Äù

Silence.

> **KHENSU (shouting now):**  
> ‚ÄúWHO DARES?!‚Äù

The entire chamber quaked as his **Eyes flared**, golden and terrible. Lights flickered. Technicians stumbled. An underling dropped to his knees.

> **KHENSU:**  
> ‚ÄúScan the planet. I want every voice. Every name. And send word to the Council‚ÄîI demand audience. A theft has occurred. A theft of _divinity_.‚Äù

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Emergency Alert: Abydos Primus**

#### Location: Fort Triumphis ‚Äì Central Vox Command
#### Time: 0435, local time
#### Personnel: Commissar Marcus Vrangell

The call came through on a priority-red vox-band. Vox-Adept Cyrene stammered as she handed Vrangell the data-slate, sweat on her brow.

> **CYRENE:**  
> ‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶ orbital augurs picked up a vessel. Not of Imperial make.‚Äù

> **VRANGELL (reading):**  
> ‚ÄúShape analysis‚Ä¶ pyramidal. Energy profile‚Ä¶ unknown. Gravimetric displacement exceeds any known freighter class‚Ä¶‚Äù

He lowered the slate slowly.

> **VRANGELL (quietly):**  
> ‚ÄúThe stars have shifted.‚Äù

---

The **holo-projection** shimmered to life in the strategy chamber. A strange ship hung in orbit like an inverted ziggurat‚Äî**alien** yet eerily symmetrical.

The senior officers around Vrangell murmured.

> **VOSTROYAN CAPTAIN:**  
> ‚ÄúXeno scum? Eldar? Tau?‚Äù

> **MECHANICUS LIAISON:**  
> ‚ÄúNo warp signature. No psychic wake. It arrived‚Ä¶ silently.‚Äù

> **VRANGELL:**  
> _‚ÄúAnd Vigilant Sky?‚Äù_

> **AIDE:**  
> ‚ÄúNo arrival yet, Commissar. Warp tides remain unstable. Projected delay: 4‚Äì18 standard months.‚Äù

> **VRANGELL:**  
> ‚ÄúThen we hold.‚Äù

He looked out the narrow window slit, where the **imperial flag snapped above the cathedral**, and clenched his jaw.

> **VRANGELL (commanding):**  
> ‚ÄúRaise void shields over Fort Triumphis. Ready anti-air batteries. Lock down all gates. I want orbital vox focused‚Äîpassive scanning only.  
> No one fires until I say. We are guests of the Emperor‚Äôs Peace. But if war comes‚Äîlet us be _hosts_.‚Äù

---

Above, **Khensu‚Äôs ship begins atmospheric descent**. Not a stealthy approach‚Äîthis is divine retribution. Fire trails mark the sky.

The God returns to his world.

And the Imperium, for the first time in this sector, stands ready to receive a **god of false gold**‚Äîwith big guns.

---

## üì° **Vox Exchange Transcript: Fort Triumphis ‚Üî Ha‚Äôtak Command Deck**

**Timestamp:** 0450 Hours, Local Time
**Encryption:** Broken Binary-Gothic / Modified Ancient Goa‚Äôuld Codec
**Status:** Abruptly Terminated

**\[BEGIN TRANSMISSION]**

> **VRANGELL (firm, imperious):**
> ‚ÄúUnidentified vessel in orbit over Imperial world *Abydos Primus*, this is **Senior Commissar Marcus Vrangell** of the **Adeptus Terra**, under writ from the **High Lords of Terra** and by mandate of the **God-Emperor of Mankind**.
> Identify yourself, your allegiance, and your reason for entering restricted airspace.‚Äù

\[Static. Then a smooth, deep voice responds‚Äîrich with ego and theatrical malice.]

> **KHENSU:**
> ‚Äú*I am Khensu, Voice of Ra, Lord of the Outer Reach, Keeper of the Throne of Abydos, Bringer of Dawn.*
> You speak from my throne-world, interloper. Your machines deface my holy temple. Your presence is sacrilege.‚Äù

> **VRANGELL (raising an eyebrow):**
> ‚Äú...Human vocal tones detected.‚Äù
> *\[mutters to aide]* ‚ÄúNot a xeno, then. Probably a warp cultist.‚Äù
> *\[clears throat]*
> ‚ÄúYou stand accused of **heresy**, Khensu. You invoke false gods, defy the writ of the Imperium, and claim authority where none is yours.‚Äù
> *\[pauses for emphasis]*
> ‚ÄúThis world has been reclaimed in the name of the **God-Emperor of Mankind**, rightful Master of the Galaxy.‚Äù

> **KHENSU (voice dripping with confusion and contempt):**
> ‚ÄúEmperor of *what*?
> You speak as though you are gods yourselves. But I see no starships worthy of Ra. No priests of proper blood.
> Your ‚ÄòEmperor‚Äô does not sit upon the Heliopolis Throne. He is no god‚Äî*I AM GOD.*‚Äù

> **VRANGELL (snorts):**
> ‚ÄúAnother delusional warlord clinging to pre-Imperial rubble and sun-cult gibberish.
> You dress in gold, but your soul reeks of **heresy and pride**. I‚Äôve seen ten thousand like you, and they all ended in the dirt.‚Äù

> **KHENSU (indignant):**
> ‚Äú*I reigned over this world when your kind were still huddling in caves!*
> This planet was tithed to me by bloodline and flame! Your crude cathedrals are **mockeries** of the divine order!‚Äù

> **VRANGELL (furious):**
> ‚ÄúEnough! You claim false divinity, you desecrate the Emperor‚Äôs Light, and you threaten His appointed emissaries.
> Hear this, Khensu: You are guilty of **treason against mankind**, and I will see your skull on a pike beneath the spires of Fort Triumphis.‚Äù

> **KHENSU (furious):**
> ‚ÄúThen prepare your pitiful legions. I shall scour your monuments from the sand and salt your bones with molten Naquadah.
> I will return this world to its rightful worship and **burn your ‚ÄòImperium‚Äô from the sky**!‚Äù

> **VRANGELL (smirking):**
> ‚ÄúPlease do try.‚Äù

**\[TRANSMISSION TERMINATED]**

---

### üéñÔ∏è **Aftermath:**

**Fort Triumphis goes to full alert.**
Imperial Guardsmen rush to walls, Kriegers reinforce firing positions, and Vostroyans light their ceremonial pipes‚Äîgrim smiles beneath thick mustaches.

**Orbital sirens blare.**
The cathedral-bastion begins to chant the **Litany of Defiance**. Even the Mechanicus begin transferring sacred machine spirits into artillery units.

Meanwhile, aboard the *Divine Light of Ra‚Äôs Wrath*, Khensu dons his ornate jackal-helm and arms his Jaffa warriors.

> **KHENSU:**
> ‚ÄúLet them see whose god answers prayers today.‚Äù

---

Here is a dramatic moment worthy of the Imperial Creed‚ÄîCommissar Vrangell rallying his soldiers in the cathedral-square of Fort Triumphis as the false god looms above. Then the storm breaks. The Imperium does not flinch.

---

## üéñÔ∏è **Fort Triumphis ‚Äì Cathedral Square**

**Time: T-minus 3 minutes to bombardment**  
**Personnel: 2nd Krieger Line, 4th Vostroyan, Mechanicus Magos-Detachments, Civilian Militia**

The heat is dry, oppressive. The wind kicks up dust over the outer fort walls. In the sky, like a blot of gold madness, the Goa‚Äôuld mothership _Divine Light of Ra‚Äôs Wrath_ casts a shadow over the desert.

The soldiers of the Imperium‚Äî**some grim, some wide-eyed, all ready**‚Äîgather at the steps of the grand basilica built atop the stargate.

**Commissar Marcus Vrangell**, clad in black and red, his aquila gleaming in the noonlight, steps onto a raised vox-pulpit. He looks out over the assembled defenders. Then he speaks‚Äînot like a man‚Äîbut like the **voice of the Imperium made flesh**.

---

### üì¢ **Speech of the Commissar**

> ‚Äú**Brothers. Sisters. Warriors of the Emperor‚Äôs Will.**
> 
> A few minutes ago, I spoke to a creature that claimed to be a god.  
> He had the voice of a man, the hunger of a tyrant, and the mind of a child.
> 
> He asked _whose world this is_. I told him. _This is Mankind‚Äôs world._
> 
> He laughed. He spoke of pyramids and bloodlines and ‚Äòdivine right‚Äô.  
> I spoke of **duty, loyalty, sacrifice, and firepower**.
> 
> He threatened to burn us from the sky. I said: _then bring the flame_.
> 
> And now, he comes.
> 
> He comes not as a god. But as another pretender. A shimmering idol from the dark, who believes that gold makes him eternal.
> 
> But I‚Äôve seen _gold burn_.
> 
> I‚Äôve seen tyrants fall. I‚Äôve seen xenos scream. I‚Äôve seen **entire empires crumble** before a single Guardsman who stood his ground.
> 
> So let him come. Let the sky rain fire. Let his jackal-faced warriors march across our dunes.
> 
> He will find that this world is already taken.
> 
> He will find **YOU**.
> 
> He will find **Kriegers who do not know fear**.  
> He will find **Vostroyans who‚Äôve buried tyrants before breakfast**.  
> He will find **Mechanicus servitors plugged into heavy plasma cannons, whispering binary prayers of vengeance**.
> 
> And above all‚Äîhe will find that the **Emperor is already here**.
> 
> So ready your lasguns. Bless your bayonets. Say your last prayers‚Äînot for your deaths, but for **his**.
> 
> And remember, if this is the day we die‚Äî_then we die under the banner of Mankind, and no false god shall take that from us._‚Äù

The final line echoes across the square as troops raise their rifles and cheer. Even the normally silent Kriegers nod in grim approval.

---

## ‚òÑÔ∏è **Battle of Fort Triumphis ‚Äì Opening Salvo**

### **0459 Hours**

From orbit, the _Divine Light of Ra‚Äôs Wrath_ opens fire.

**Columns of plasma bolts and particle bursts** streak toward the surface, howling through atmosphere like celestial spears.

Fort Triumphis is ready.

The **void shields engage** with a crackling thunder, absorbing the initial blast like a wall of screaming energy. Lightning crawls across the shield as impact after impact strikes it.

Then return fire.

**Flak turrets, macro-las emplacements, quad autocannons**‚Äîthe outer bastions light up in defiant retaliation. A **Mechanicus macro-turret**‚Äînamed _‚ÄúRighteous Heat Transfer No.17‚Äù_‚Äîlaunches a blast of reverse-engineered plasma toward the sky, forcing the mothership to raise its own shields.

> **KHENSU (on his bridge, furious):**  
> _‚ÄúWhy do they not fall? Why do they still resist?!‚Äù_

Below, **dropships of Jaffa warriors** descend. But as they land, **Kriegers emerge from trenches**, lasguns humming, firing in perfect volley coordination.

One Vostroyan sergeant kisses an aquila trinket and yells:

> **‚ÄúFor Holy Terra!‚Äù**

The first wave of Jaffa **never reaches the outer gates**.

Mechanicus Skitarii detachments sweep flanks, their galvanic rifles cracking with arcs of blue. One heavy bolter emplacement tears through five Jaffa in a burst of pulverized gold armor.

The _Imperium holds_.

> **VRANGELL (on vox-net):**  
> ‚ÄúStand fast. Reinforcements will come.  
> Until then‚Äîwe are the Emperor‚Äôs wrath given form.‚Äù

---

## ‚òÑÔ∏è **Phase Two ‚Äì The Wrath of Khensu**

#### Location: Orbit over Abydos ‚Äì _Divine Light of Ra‚Äôs Wrath_
#### Status: Shield Integrity 37%, Weapons Systems Degrading

> **KHENSU (roaring):**  
> ‚ÄúThey are _worms!_ They are _mortals!_ This should be ash by now!‚Äù

His voice echoed through the golden command deck of the Ha‚Äôtak mothership. Servants and Jaffa alike kept their heads bowed, terrified. The golden god trembled‚Äînot with fear, but with **injured divinity**.

Another tremor rocked the ship. Alarms whined. Sparks burst from a control console.

> **TECH-PRIESTESSED JAFFA:**  
> ‚ÄúShield matrix unstable, my Lord. Primary emitters damaged. We‚Äî‚Äù

> **KHENSU:**  
> ‚ÄúSilence! I will not be undone by dirt-world cultists in rags and steel!‚Äù

He swept his hand over the tactical display, zooming in on Fort Triumphis below‚Äîits towers still burning with return fire, its banners of the double-headed eagle snapping in the wind. **No signs of damage.**

> **KHENSU:**  
> ‚ÄúSend the rest. _All of them._ Every Jaffa aboard. Arm the reserves. Strip the hold if you must.  
> I want _every last jackal, spearman, and slave_ on the surface!‚Äù

> **AIDE (hesitant):**  
> ‚ÄúThat would leave the ship unguarded, my lord‚Äî‚Äù

> **KHENSU:**  
> ‚Äú_DO IT!_ Let the worms have the ashes of my wrath! I will see their city buried beneath a sea of gold and fire!‚Äù

---

## üéñÔ∏è **Groundside ‚Äì Fort Triumphis**

More dropships scream across the horizon‚Äî**over a dozen**, dust clouds billowing as they deploy Khensu‚Äôs final wave of elite Jaffa warriors, glittering in their armor, their staff weapons glowing.

But the **Kriegers were waiting.**

With the amount of sand all around, the diligent Kriegers were able to build up nigh-impervious sand-bag fortifications.

From the trenches and turret emplacements, from behind the sand-bags, the Death Korps of Krieg fire in perfect coordinated volleys. Every motion is rehearsed, every target tracked with inhuman calm.

> **Krieger Sergeant (over vox):**  
> ‚ÄúRange 300. Pattern gamma. Target center mass. Begin.‚Äù

A _storm of las-fire_ erupts across the plain. Staff weapons fire arcs high and wide‚Äî**imprecise**, **erratic**‚Äîwhile the Kriegers remain crouched and precise. **Not a single round wasted.**

Jaffa fall in heaps, their armor melting and bursting under massed volleys. Those who try to charge are met with **bayonets and shovels**‚Äîsilent, merciless engagements.

> **Vostroyan Officer:**  
> ‚ÄúThey fight like parade gladiators! Ha! Pretty gold helmets don‚Äôt stop las rounds!‚Äù

The Mechanicus join from the flanks‚Äî**Skitarii Ranger teams**, augmented reflexes enhanced by predictive subroutines, pick off fleeing Jaffa with galvanic headshots. The battlefield becomes a **slaughter**, and yet _no Guardsman is even wounded_.

---

## üö® **Aboard the Divine Light of Ra‚Äôs Wrath**

The bridge is chaos. The last crew scramble. The shield finally **collapses** with a crack like splitting heavens.

Then a final shot‚Äîfrom a **quad-lascannon nest** mounted on the Fort‚Äôs bastion‚Äî**strikes the mothership‚Äôs central node.**

Fire blossoms in the belly of the great ship. Smoke pours from its pyramidal corners. Control is lost.

> **AUTOMATED SYSTEM (Ancient Goa‚Äôuld):**  
> ‚ÄúGravity stabilization failure. Core rupture imminent. Brace for impact.‚Äù

Khensu screams‚Äînot a god now, but a man terrified of death, betrayed by his own belief in immortality.

> ‚Äú_I am Ra‚Äôs Will! I am the Flame of Suns! I CANNOT DIE!_‚Äù

The ship **plummets**‚Äîa golden pyramid ablaze, descending in fury toward the empty desert outside the city walls.

## üí• **Crash Site ‚Äì 18 Kilometers West of Fort Triumphis**

The Divine Light of Ra‚Äôs Wrath **impacts the dunes**, skidding across the sands in a thunderous explosion of flame, gold, and shattered arrogance.

A **massive fireball** rises. The sands turn to glass.

The shockwave rolls outward, reaching the walls of Fort Triumphis. Windows rattle. Dust falls from the ceilings. Then silence.

**And then‚Äîcheering.**

> **VRANGELL (watching from tower, calmly):**  
> ‚ÄúFalse god, meet real gravity.‚Äù

He turns to his aide.

> **VRANGELL:**  
> ‚ÄúSend a recon team to the crash site. If the heretic lives, I want his head. If he‚Äôs dead‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll take his ship.‚Äù

## ‚öîÔ∏è **Scene: The Wreck of the Divine Light**

**Location:** Western Dunes, 18 kilometers from Fort Triumphis
**Time:** +4 hours post-crash
**Personnel:** Krieger Recon Squad Theta-9, Vostroyan Grenadiers, Mechanicus Salvage Unit 42-Beta

The desert is silent but for the hum of lascarbines and the crackling of fires in the distance.

The fallen mothership, once resplendent in gold and alien ornament, now lies partially buried in a blackened trench of its own making. Its prow is shattered. **Engines melted. Hull split.** The vast pyramid still pulses faintly with residual energy.

The **Imperial recon force** moves in cautiously. Krieger soldiers in sand-dusted greatcoats sweep for threats, lasguns raised. **Vox-drone servitors** buzz overhead, scanning for life signs.

> **Krieger Sergeant (vox):**
> ‚ÄúContact. Inner decks. Multiple readings. Permission to breach.‚Äù

> **Commissar Vrangell (vox):**
> ‚ÄúGranted. Bring me their god.‚Äù

### üîß **Breach & Engagement**

The breach is surgical. Kriegers plant melta-charges along a collapsed side hatch. The blast cuts through alien alloys with surgical precision. As the smoke clears, **the squad storms in**‚Äîefficient, wordless, practiced.

Inside, remnants of Jaffa elites rally in a last stand. They wear battle damage and desperation, some still chanting for Ra.

> **Khensu (battered, yet defiant):**
> ‚ÄúI am a living sun! I command the heavens! I will not be taken‚Äî‚Äù

> **Krieger Grenadier (interrupts):**
> *\[Throws photon-flash grenade.]*

The **Jaffa are blinded and cut down** in seconds. Several are left alive for questioning. One slumps to the ground sobbing.

Khensu, shaken and bleeding from a head wound, tries to raise his staff weapon‚Äî**too slow.**

**A Krieger slams the butt of his lasgun into Khensu‚Äôs stomach.** The god-king wheezes and falls to one knee. Before he can speak again, **metal restraints clamp around his arms and throat.**

> **Krieger Vox-Officer:**
> ‚ÄúSubject secured. Target neutralized. False deity apprehended.‚Äù

## ‚õìÔ∏è **Scene: Fort Triumphis ‚Äì Interrogation Sublevel**

Khensu is dragged in chains into the **underground chambers** of Fort Triumphis. The corridor walls are decorated with **Imperial purity seals and bronze aquilas**, reminders that this is the dominion of the *real* god.

He is placed in a reinforced **psy-blocked cell**, his voice choked by an electrogag-collar. **Magos Rhox**, flanked by datascribes and servo-skulls, observes through a glass screen.

> **Magos Rhox:**
> ‚ÄúA specimen of considerable linguistic mimicry. Humanoid morphology, yet technosorcerous enhancements embedded in the sternum. Preliminary analysis suggests synthetic parasitic symbiosis.‚Äù
>
> *\[Turns to assistant]*
> ‚ÄúAlert the Ordo Xenos. I believe we have found‚Ä¶ a **talking heresy**.‚Äù

> **Vrangell (entering with calm swagger):**
> ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt call it ‚Äòtalking.‚Äô More like ranting.‚Äù

He leans close to the observation panel.

> **Vrangell:**
> ‚ÄúTell me, Magos‚Äîdo you think it dreams?
> If so, I hope it dreams of the moment we tore it from the sky.‚Äù
