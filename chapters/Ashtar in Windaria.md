Ashtar Sheran walked through the field, his long hair blowing in the wind, burned out Leman Russ tanks scattered all around. He looked around at the scenery with a feeling of deep sorrow.

He climbed aboard one of the burned out Leman Russ tanks, and he wept. He wept for the soldiers who died in this pointless greedy struggle; He wept for all the wars that the Imperium has ever waged; He wept for how things could have gone differently.

**Ashtar Sheran:** *(with a look of sorrow)*
>Things could have gone differently for you, you know. Things should have gone the right way. But no, you screwed it all up. The curse of ambition.

Ashtar Sheran directed his gaze to the gold-plated double-headed eagle decoration at the helm of the tank. He stretched out his hand, as if to tear off the aquilla from the tank and to crush it. But at the last moment, he eased up a bit, and began gently caressing the aquilla figure, wiping the dust and ash off it.

**Ashtar Sheran:** *(with a warm and gentle look)*
>I have not forgotten you either. Do not think that I have abandoned you. In due time, I will return.
