### 📍 **Pre-Gate Briefing – Fort Sanctus Veritus**

> **Commissar Vrangell (addressing assembled troops):**  
> “Brothers of the Emperor, the Goa’uld infestation has spread far beyond Abydos. We strike now—not for conquest, but for *purification*.  
> They call themselves gods. We will show them the folly of falsehood.  
> They think themselves lords of ancient stars. We will remind them who *truly* owns the legacy of Mankind.”

Binary prayer-hymns from the Mechanicus echo in the background as the gate begins to spin, chevrons locking into place.

The Stargate **activates**. Blue plasma whirlpools ripple outward, like a tear in space itself.

> **Inquisitor Vallan:**  
> “We strike fast. We strike brutal. No negotiations. No delays. Let the first world burn, and the rest will tremble.”

---

### 🌍 **Arrival – P3-Karn, Outer Abydosian Cluster**

The Imperial gate team emerges into the interior of a colossal stone ziggurat, eerily similar in architecture to the temple on Abydos, reminiscent of Ancient Earth architecture—Mayan to be exact.

The room that they emerge in is roughly square or rectangular, made of stone floor, ceiling, and walls with carved Mayan-esque glyphs depicting the victories and mythology of the Goa'uld. Huge stone faces jut out from the walls like Medieval-punk versions of Stalinist propoganda sculptures. Pillars adorned with golden serpents, glowing glyphs in no known dialect.

The outer walls of the room are not solid but they are in fact a balcony held up by massive stone columns shaped like Art Deco reneditions of Jaffa warriors. Beyond, the view is of a dense jungle, with more ziggurats and stone cities of a similar architecture style defiantly sticking up above the trees. It's as if Mesoamerican and Brutalist had a baby.

All around the perimeter of the room, perpetual fires burn in bronze bowls on stone platforms, kept alit fed by some hydrocarbon fluid pumped up from the bowels of the stone behemoth.

The **Krieg** immediately fan out, lasrifles at the ready. The **Vostroyans** take the upper balconies.

Then—

**The alarm klaxons begin.**  
Brazen horns. Glowing glyphs pulsing red.  
A bone-grinding noise fills the entire chamber as massive sections of the stone walls slowly rise up, pulled by some ancient mechanisms. With a prolonged warcry, the first wave of **Jaffa shock troops** flood in.

---

### ⚔️ **The Battle Begins**

> **Jaffa Commander (shouting):**  
> “For Lord Nerakh-Toth! Slay the invaders!”

But they are not prepared for the **Imperial Guard**.

**Krieg lasguns** fire in disciplined volleys—clean, efficient, unrelenting.  
**Vostroyan plasma gunners** vaporize entire lines of Jaffa in molten flashes.  
**Kastelan robots**, walking tanks from the Mechanicus, engage with phosphor blasters and power fists, crushing statues and skulls alike.

> **Skitarii Vanguard Vox-Cant:**  
> “Target: acquired. Faith: confirmed. Termination: imminent.”

Jaffa weapons, while lethal by Goa’uld standards, are no match for the sheer coordination, training, and psychic certainty of Imperial soldiers.

---

### 🏛️ **Temple Overrun – Enemy Routed**

Within 15 minutes, the Goa’uld defenders are annihilated.

The ziggurat temple is taken. Intel and artifacts are secured. Tech-Priests begin data-harvesting from alien terminals.

A surviving Jaffa officer is dragged before Commissar Vrangell.

> **Jaffa (defiant):**  
> “You’ve invaded the sacred domain of Lord Nerakh-Toth. He will burn your worlds for this!”

> **Vrangell (leveling his bolt pistol):**  
> “We welcome the challenge.”

*Bang.* Execution.

---

### 🕊️ **Post-Battle Summary – Fort Sanctus Veritus**

> **Inquisitor Vallan (report to Segmentum Command):**  
> “Imperial losses: negligible. Enemy force: exterminated.  
> Goa’uld military strength is highly centralized and reliant on intimidation over actual strategy.  
> Civilian population is indoctrinated, but potentially redeemable.  
> Recommend sterilization of ruling caste and Ecclesiarchical re-education of natives.”

> **Magos Rhox (data-stream to Mars):**  
> “Another stargate secured. More samples collected. Signs of DAoT quantum relays beneath temple foundation.  
> Ritual architecture not functional—symbolic replication only. Idiots.”

> **Vrangell (personal note):**  
> “Let them call this blasphemy. Let them cry for their false gods. We are not here for their souls.  
> We are here for their silence.”

**Operation Cauterized Vein**  
**Filed Under: Crusade Progress Report 07-A – Segmentum Solar, Xenos Designation: "Goa’uld"**

### ⚔️ **Phase Two: Total Planetary Securing**

**Three hours after the temple assault**, the Imperials began full planetary deployment through the Stargate. Krieger engineers constructed forward bastions using prefabricated modules blessed by the Mechanicus. Vox relays went up. Orbital survey drones were deployed from Fort Sanctus Veritus via gate-packable drop-cylinders.

Distinguished Commissar Marcus Vrangell emerges out of the ziggurat with his troops.

> **Commissar Vrangell:**  
> “This world was once a tumor. Now we make it a vein in the Emperor’s circulatory domain.”

The Imperials follow the Roman-style cobblestone road, flanked by ram-headed sphinxes, through the dense jungle. **Kastelan robots**, with the thump-thump of mechanical war elephants, march on the road to the stone city in the distance, while Kriegers are ordered to sweep the surrounding jungle for any defenders. None are found.

The Imperial army reaches the city, with walls made of huge granite blocks, resembling Makchu Pikchu's fortifications. The Kastelan Robots and Krieg artillery units take up positions and aim at the thick stone walls.

All eyes are focused on their commanding officer, waiting to give the signal. Commissar Vrangell unsheathes his chain sword, slowly and triumphantly raises it high, and then swiftly cuts through the air down.

**KA-BOOM**

With a ferocious roar and a volley of plasma fire and artillery shells the walls are easily breached.

---

**Krieg regiments** swept the cities. The **Vostroyan Firstborn** took the highlands and plateau outposts. **Mechanicus Skitarii** were deployed to dismantle or reappropriate Goa’uld infrastructure.

Every Goa’uld structure was **surrounded, stormed, and sterilized**.

The Jaffa fought valiantly. Honorably. Bravely.

And were **slaughtered** to the last.

Most wore ceremonial armor, their weapons reliant on staff energy bursts—effective against peasant uprisings, but meaningless before the **lasrifles, meltas, and plasma** of the Astra Militarum.

Many of the **Kriegers didn’t even flinch** as they were struck. A Jaffa blast that would fell a Goa’uld elite barely singed a trooper’s carapace. One by one, the Jaffa were **systematically rooted from garrisons, outposts, and hidden jungle strongholds**.

> **Krieg Sergeant (before incinerating a bunker):**  
> “Compliance denied. Request: authorized purgation.”  
> 🔥 *Bunker destroyed with multi-melta charge.*

Entire battalions of Jaffa fell back into civilian areas, hoping to gain support.

They received none.

**The local human populace**, long oppressed, saw their “gods” bleeding for the first time. Their faith shattered.

Some even took up arms and joined the Imperials.

---

### **The Goa’uld Are Hunted Like Beasts**

Surviving Goa’uld attempted to flee—boarding escape gliders, activating ring transporters, and even retreating into stasis chambers.

But the **Ordo Xenos had planned this.**

A network of **psykers and sensor-adepts** tracked the bio-energetic signatures unique to the Goa’uld symbiotes. Ring transporters were rigged to explode. Goa’uld lieutenants were cornered and gunned down in their palaces.

> **Inquisitor Vallan (watching a Goa’uld execution):**  
> “Possession of a human body by a xeno-worm… Unacceptable. Heretical.  
> The only worm blessed by the Ecclesiarchy is the corpse-worm sanctifying the flesh.”

One Goa’uld attempted to offer tribute—precious minerals, Naquadah caches, slave-brides.

> **Commissar Vrangell:**  
> “You cannot bribe Mankind’s wrath.  
> Only death earns you mercy.”

**He was hanged from the central obelisk of the capital, a warning to all.**

---

### 🏛️ **Declaration of Compliance**

On the 11th day, **P3-Karn was officially declared compliant.**

A massive rally was held at the Temple of Nerakh-Toth—renamed **Sanctum Imperator Triumphant**. Ecclesiarchy banners were raised atop Goa’uld statues, which were then destroyed by flame and faith.

> **Commissar Vrangell (public address):**  
> “You were lied to. Lied to by parasites that wore the flesh of men, and told you it was divine.  
> But now… now you are free. Now you belong to something *true*.  
> You are children of the Imperium. You are dust under His gaze. And that is *glory*.”

**Hundreds of thousands of Karnite citizens wept and knelt.**  
Those who resisted were summarily shot.

A new **Governor-Provost** was installed. The **Cult Mechanicus** took over Goa’uld research facilities and began excavating deeper ruins. A **Cathedral of Cleansing Light** began construction atop the desecrated Pyramid of Toth.

---

### 🛑 **Casualty Counts**

- Astra Militarum: 12 killed, 54 wounded (minor)
- Mechanicus: 1 Tech-Adept lost (killed by Goa’uld toxin trap)
- Jaffa: 19,300+ confirmed kills
- Goa’uld: 7 confirmed dead, 2 captured alive
- Civilian unrest: 0 incidents reported

---

### ✅ **Final Report (Filed by Comissar Vrangell to the High Lords of Terra):**

> “P3-Karn has been liberated and is now a loyal mining and military outpost of the Imperium.  
> Goa’uld presence purged. Stargate secured. Faith restored.  
> Recommend planetary classification: **Feudal-Tech/Resource-Strategic (Compliant)**.”

---

### 📍 **Fort Sanctus Veritus – Standing Ovation**

Commissar Marcus Vrangell’s approval ratings among the High Lords spike. His name becomes a rallying cry.

> **Governor Elric Vann-Holt of Veritus Prime:**  
> “He has turned a backwater find into a Crusade. We may be looking at a future Lord Solar.”

### 🧴 **Ecclesiarchy Response:**

> **Arch-Confessor Helbrant:**  
> “This… is sacred war. A war not just of flame and las, but of soul and doctrine. The Goa’uld claim divinity? Then let them meet ours in battle.”

Multiple shrines to the Emperor-as-Warrior-God begin popping up on newly compliant gate worlds, stylized to mock and overwrite Goa’uld aesthetics.

### ⚙️ **Mechanicus Response:**

> **Magos Rhox (data-log):**  
> “Hostile technologies possess corrupted DAoT roots. Further recovery and sterilization are vital. Our recovery teams are already moving.  
> Recommend full exploration of gate network nodes: Goa’uld systems represent a fractured mirror of Mankind’s golden age.”

### **Scene: “The Three Thrones of Discord”**  
_Location: Aboard Ra’s flagship, the Solar Citadel, in high orbit over the world of Sekhmet._

The throne chamber was carved from gold-veined obsidian, aglow with red-gold light filtered through crystalline sun lenses. Behind each throne, towering statues loomed—Ra’s falcon-headed effigy blazed with internal flame; Sobek’s crocodilian guardian snarled in frozen fury; Apophis’s serpent idol coiled, mouth agape in eternal threat. Three System Lords had assembled here, as they had not done in centuries.

Ra’s throne hovered slightly above the others, radiant in solar majesty. He leaned forward, golden mask impassive, voice like burning coals.

**RA**:  
> “Khensu has not responded to summons in thirty rotations. No ship’s beacon. No transmissions. Nothing.”

**APOPHIS**:  
> “Perhaps he was overthrown by his slaves. He was always… sentimental.”

**RA**:  
> “Nonsense. He may be dull, but he was not weak. Something else is at work.”

**RA**:  
> _“First Khensu vanishes. Then Karn falls, without warning, without battle cries—wrenched from the Gate like a limb torn from its socket. And now this...”_

He gestured with two fingers. A hologlyph shimmered midair—an audio-visual recording recovered from a listening post near P3-Karn. The image stuttered into view:

---

**[TRANSMISSION — SOURCE: UNKNOWN MILITANT BROADCAST]**  
_Grainy, metallic vox-channel voice. Crimson Aquila emblem over rotating stars. Background chants in Low Gothic._

> “To all who dwell in false dominions—hear the word of the God-Emperor of Mankind.  
> You kneel to worms who pretend to be gods. We kneel to the Flame of Terra.  
> Let it be known: we have come not to parley, but to cleanse.  
> You will be judged, weighed, and found wanting.  
> Compliance brings survival. Resistance brings fire.  
> We are the Imperium. We are retribution.”

---

Another overlay followed—less formal, more chaotic. As if from a rebel transmission array, pirate-boosted across multiple systems.

---

**[TRANSMISSION — REBEL FREQUENCY, SECTOR ABYDOS]**

> “The Goa’uld are _false gods_! I saw it with my own eyes—their Jaffa bled like any man.  
> The God-Emperor of Mankind has given us the courage to rise!  
> Their ‘divinity’ is an illusion built on fear.  
> We have allies now. We have hope.  
> _Death to the parasites!_ Long live the Imperium!”

---

A third fragment, intercepted from a Goa’uld listening post in the Hathor system:

---

**[TRANSMISSION — CHANTING CROWD, PLANET UNKNOWN]**

> “Glory to Him on Terra!  
> Glory to the Golden Throne!  
> Death to the Serpent-Hosts!  
> Let His Light cleanse the stars!”

---

**Goa’uld Officer (trembling):**
> “It came from Abydos. Their world now hosts *them*. Whoever they are…”

The room crackled with tension. Sobek’s voice rolled like thunder from a crocodile’s throat.

**SOBEK**:  
> _“Blasphemy. Treason. Infection. Whoever they are, they turn the slaves into zealots. Karn fell because its people welcomed these invaders. Better to glass such worlds.”_

Apophis sneered from his seat, fingers coiled like snakes.

**APOPHIS**:  
> _“No... not welcomed. Overwhelmed. This Imperium does not bargain or infiltrate. It strikes. Their opening move was Abydos. Mark my words.”_

He leaned forward, eyes gleaming with malice.

**APOPHIS (cont’d)**:  
> _“Only from Abydos could such a precise assault have launched. Karn's gate was isolated. The coordinates must have been taken. They control the Gate.”_

Ra remained still, contemplative. His voice echoed with the power of a sun bound in flesh.

**RA**:  
> _“Khensu... weak, cunning, but no traitor. He would not have gone silent by choice. No. The invaders took Abydos. Through stealth or storm. This Imperium... they strike from world to world, claiming gates, erasing gods.”_

A silence fell, like the moment before a nova flare.

Ra stood.

**RA (declarative)**:  
> _“Sobek. You will go to Abydos. Take your fleet—Ha’tak and Cheops-class dreadnoughts. Enter orbit and purge the surface. If these ‘Men of the Imperium’ yet dwell there... reduce them to ash. Reclaim the gate. Restore my dominion.”_

Sobek rose with relish, slamming his fist to his chestplate.

**SOBEK**:  
> _“By your radiance, my Pharaoh.”_

Apophis smirked darkly.

**APOPHIS (to himself)**:  
> _“Let Sobek test their fire. Then we will see how gods die.”_

_Scene fades with the golden eye of Ra shining like a miniature star behind the throne, watching as Sobek’s fleet prepares to descend upon Abydos… unaware that the Imperium awaits with bolter and flame._

---

## **The Arrival of Sobek’s Fleet**

The void shimmered and tore themselves open as Sobek’s fleet burst forth from hyperspace—three Ha’tak motherships, flanked by five Cheops-class escort vessels, and a wedge-shaped command barque bearing Sobek’s personal crest: the crowned crocodile devouring the sun.

They emerged in formation above the tan and ochre sphere of _Abydos_, its desert winds swirling below. But Sobek’s golden eyes narrowed the moment the flagship sensors adjusted.

There was _something else_ in orbit.

Hanging above the planet was a structure—no, a _warship_—unlike anything Sobek had ever seen in his centuries of rule.

**SOBEK**:  
_"What… is that?”_

The First Prime stepped forward to the holoscreen, his armored hand trembling slightly.

It loomed like a cathedral built by titans. Nearly two kilometers long, the warship bore baroque armor plating covered in grim engravings—winged skulls, swords wreathed in fire, and an imperial double-headed eagle cast in gold that spanned the prow. Its dorsal spires resembled monolithic towers, complete with stained-glass windows that flickered with internal light.

Massive statues of robed warriors—some with outstretched arms, others holding books and blades—stood motionless in alcoves along the hull. Its engines pulsed like the hearts of stars, red and angry.

**FIRST PRIME**:  
_"A temple… no… a **war temple.**”

**SOBEK (growling)**:  
> _"That is no Goa’uld design. No Ancient. No Replicator construct. It is unknown. And too large to be hidden. Why has this civilization not entered our dominion before?"_

He turned sharply toward his comms officer.

**SOBEK**:  
_"Hail them. Now."_

**FIRST PRIME (hesitantly)**:  
_"And if they do not answer?"_

**SOBEK**:  
_"Then we show them the consequence of defiance."_

But behind Sobek’s bravado, a flicker of unease crept in. For the first time in centuries, he was uncertain of what god he faced.

---

## **_Vigilant Sky_, Imperial Frigate in Orbit**

Aboard the _Vigilant Sky_, Frigate-Class of the Navis Imperialis, the bridge was cast in brass light filtered through stained glass depicting the Triumph of Saint Macharius. Vox-cantors chanted litanies of vigilance while servitors clicked through auspex data.

An alarm klaxon moaned across the bridge.

**SENIOR SENSORIUM OFFICER**:  
_"Multiple signatures have entered from high-velocity warp-equivalent transition… but—no Geller Field traces. No warp eddy trails. No Navigator resonance."_

**LORD-CAPTAN GIHRAN**:  
_"Not possible."_  

He rose from his command throne, adjusting the red sash of his station.

**LORD-CAPTAN GIHRAN (cont’d)**:  
_"Warp-less FTL? That's... abominable tech. Or xenos craft. Display them."_

The hololith flickered, casting blue-green projections across the chamber. The forms of Ha’tak vessels appeared—pyramidal, massive, edged with glowing rings and arcane inscriptions.

**TACTICAL ADEPT**:  
_"They resemble... truncated Blackstone Fortresses. But the scale is inverted—smaller, more mobile."_

**ENGINSEER-VASSAL THORGAN**:  
_"Sensors detect exotic energy emissions—unknown ionization and plasma distortion. Possibly xenos plasma drives. Shields hold a consistent flux barrier."_

**GIHRAN**:  
_"Too advanced for Orks. Too geometric for Eldar. Could they be new Chaos designs?”_

**TACTICAL ADEPT (whispering)**:  
_"Or loyalist forgeries corrupted by the warp..."_

The Lord-Captain turned toward the observation arch, looking out at the intruders.

**GIHRAN (quietly)**:  
_"No. They are testing us. Whoever they are, they move with intent. Not madness."_

He gripped the rail.

**GIHRAN (louder)**:  
_"This system is under the protection of the God-Emperor of Mankind. Arm weapons. Hold position. Ready vox-channel. If they breach the silence—respond. If they fire first…”_

He paused, then gave the ancient order.

**GIHRAN**:  
_"…sanction by flame."_


---

## **First Contact – Sobek and Gihran**

Aboard the bridge of the _Vigilant Sky_, incense smoke drifted lazily between cogitator stacks and stained glass lumen-panels. The vox-sigil flickered.

**VOX-THAUMATURGIST**:  
_"Incoming hail from the xenos fleet, Lord-Captain. Language packet unfamiliar. Auto-cant dialect parsers engaged."_

**LORD-CAPTAIN GIHRAN**:  
_"Let it through. I will meet this… pretender personally."_

The forward auspex shrine unfolded into a grand communication window—projected in flickering blue lumens. Across the stars, aboard his command Ha’tak, Sobek stood tall in gold-sheen armor, his crocodilian helm retracted to show a humanoid face. A stern jaw, sun-baked skin, and burning green eyes. The chamber behind him shimmered with hieroglyphic script and torch-like plasma sconces.

Both men paused. Each expected something _other_.

**Sobek** looked upon a pale-skinned man draped in dark navy finery trimmed in gold. A red sash of command crossed his chest. Behind him loomed _gothic archways_, _statues of saints_, and a **two-headed eagle** of burnished bronze.

**Gihran**, in turn, saw a creature that looked human—but not. His features were too symmetrical, his posture _too composed_. He radiated _divinity_ in the way sorcerers or demagogues did.

Then Gihran spoke—loudly and without hesitation.

**GIHRAN (intoning)**:  
> _"I am Lord-Captain Tiberius Gihran of the Vigilant Sky, Commander of the Navis Imperialis._  
> _By the Divine Mandate of the Golden Throne, under the watchful gaze of the God-Emperor of Mankind, I demand to know your purpose in these void-lanes, intruding upon a world under Imperial Compliance!"_

A beat passed. Sobek raised an eyebrow.

**SOBEK (carefully)**:  
>_"I am Sobek, Lord of the Ninth System, General of the Abydonian Sectors, and Servant of the Great Ra._  
>_We do not recognize your ‘Imperium’ nor this ‘God-Emperor’. What is your origin? And what is your purpose in **my** system?"_

Gihran stood straighter, if that was possible.

**GIHRAN (with ceremonial weight)**:  
>_"We are the Imperium of Man._  
>_The rightful and holy dominion of Humanity, born from the sacred soil of **Terra**—our origin world, cradle of civilization._  
>_For over ten thousand years, we have endured war, heresy, and the warp, united under the immortal will of the God-Emperor of Holy Terra_.  
>_You trespass upon a world now in Imperial hands. State your intent, xeno."_

Sobek narrowed his eyes. But then… something clicked.

**SOBEK (suspiciously)**:  
_"You are… human? Then you are Tau’ri?”_

The bridge of the _Vigilant Sky_ stiffened. Gihran’s eyes flared.

**GIHRAN (indignant)**:  
>"Tau’va?! By the Throne—do I look like a _blue-skinned xeno apostate_ to you?!"  

He motioned to his pale face, squared jaw, and distinctly _non-Tau_ physique.

**GIHRAN (furious)**:  
> "I have crushed Tau enclaves in the Charadon Drift, burned their diplomats with promethium, and aired their battlesuits out into the void.  
> We are _not_ Tau. We are _Mankind_. Pure-blooded, loyalist, fire-forged Humanity!"_

Sobek blinked—more confused than threatened.

**SOBEK**:  
_"Then... not Tau’ri either? You say… Terra?”_

**GIHRAN (calming slightly)**:  
>"Yes. _Terra_. Not Tau’ri.  
>A planet in the _Galactic Core_. Encircled by the Halo Bastion Rings, defended by void shields older than your myths.  
>It is not myth. It is _reality_. From there, the Emperor guides a million worlds and ten million legions.  
>This Imperium has stood longer than your petty empires have existed."

Sobek shook his head, lips curling into a wary grin.

**SOBEK (scoffing)**:  
> _"The Galactic Core is lifeless. No habitable planets exist there. Black holes, gravitational chaos… Terra cannot be there._  
>_We would know.”_

Gihran turned to a servitor. A series of projections lit the bridge—stellar charts, dataslate banners, orbital schematics of the Segmentum Solar.

Then came **images**—fragments of Terra:
- Vast hive spires clawing the sky.
- Oceans of humanity chanting the Emperor’s name.
- Golden statues standing higher than pyramids.
- War banners flying across void-bridges of Mars.

Sobek’s grin faded.

**SOBEK (quietly)**:  
_"This… is real?"_

**GIHRAN (grimly)**:  
_"This is the Throneworld. The Heart of Mankind.  
And we have come to restore order. Your reign ends here, serpent-lord."_

Sobek took an involuntary step back from the holoscreen.

The truth unfurled in his mind like a slow venom: _They were not new_. They were _ancient_. Older than most Goa’uld empires. And _vast beyond comprehension_.

And he had just brought three Ha’tak into their sights.

The transmission channel between the _Vigilant Sky_ and Sobek’s command barque still shimmered, connecting two thrones of pride across the stars. The tension between the two commanders had crystallized into something brittle—ready to shatter at a word.

**LORD-CAPTAIN GIHRAN** stepped forward, eyes like steel under the vaulted stained glass of the Imperial bridge.

**GIHRAN (coldly, with command)**:  
>“The world below—designated Abydos-Primus—is now a Compliant world of the Imperium of Man. Its inhabitants have sworn the Creed, received the Lectitio Divinitatus, and submitted to the divine light of the God-Emperor.
>You and your fleet now orbit _Imperial soil_. State your intention—or withdraw immediately.”

Across the void, **Sobek** straightened, his brow furrowing beneath the ceremonial golden helm. He spoke with tight control.

**SOBEK**:  
>“This world is a dominion of the System Lord Ra. Its people are sworn vassals to him, and by extension, to me. It was taken by sorcery or treachery. I have come to reclaim it.”

**GIHRAN (voice sharp as a blade)**:  
>“Then you admit allegiance to a known xenos parasite. A blasphemous false god who enslaves Mankind and defiles its genome. That, Lord Sobek, is _heresy_ of the highest order.”

Sobek’s jaw tightened.

**SOBEK (growling)**:  
>“Ra is a _god_, not a parasite! How _dare_ you speak of the Supreme Lord in such terms? He is divine.”

**GIHRAN (snapping)**:  
> “He is a _leech_ in golden armor. Your ‘divinity’ is a snake burrowed into the brainstem of an enslaved host.  
> The Imperium has no tolerance for your kind. We have burned worse from the galaxy.”

A heavy pause.

**GIHRAN (grimly, with finality)**:  
>“You will leave this system immediately… or super die.”

A beat. Sobek’s eyes flared.

**SOBEK (indignant, voice rising)**:  
>“I do _not_ flee before threats! I am Sobek, Fist of Ra, Warden of Karn, and you now trespass upon a divine reclamation. I come to _retake_ what was stolen. The Goa’uld shall not bow to _you!_”

Silence again.

And then—Lord-Captain Gihran leaned forward, resting one gauntleted hand on the vox lectern. His voice dropped to a thunderous tongue, each word etched in fire.

**GIHRAN**:  
>“And that is enough _causus belli_ to annihilate you.”
>“Farewell… into hell!”

---

The vox feed cut off.

Aboard the _Vigilant Sky_, sirens began to howl. Red lumen runes flashed to life. Gun crews sprang to action. Torpedo bays unsealed. The silent hum of targeting augurs warming across the Vigilant Sky’s gun decks. The Litany of Vengeance began to echo through the vox-cantors.


**Meanwhile, aboard Sobek’s barque**:

The First Prime turned to him, tension rippling in the air.

**FIRST PRIME**:  
>“My lord… one ship. Ominous, but alone. Shall we proceed with battle formation and descend upon them?”

Sobek breathed deeply, suppressing the tremor of unease.

**SOBEK (firmly)**:  
>“Yes. Whatever sorcery animates this vessel, it is still one ship. We are a _fleet_.  
>The power of Ra flows through us. The Eye of Karn will not retreat. Signal the Ha’taks—prepare attack formation.  
>We will _crack_ their floating temple open and offer its crew to the Nile of fire.”

The bridge crew roared in assent.

But in Sobek’s mind… the two-headed eagle still lingered. Watching. Waiting.

_Scene ends with both vessels preparing their weapons—one side burning with religious fury, the other with righteous wrath—while the sand-wrapped world of Abydos turns silently below, awaiting another scar in its long and blood-soaked history._

---

## **The Iron Cathedral in Battle**

In orbit over Abydos, the void shimmered with gathering tension. Sobek’s fleet of three Ha’taks, five Cheops-class escort vessels, and his personal command barque shifted into an attack wedge. Their golden pyramidal shapes gleamed in the system’s yellow light, humming with exotic energy signatures.

**SOBEK (grinning)**:  
>“There it is. The beast that dares claim Abydos as its own. Such hubris... such mass.”

_He leaned forward over the command pedestal._  

>“Lock plasma arrays. Prime staff-cannons. Fire at will.”

Jaffa soldiers scoffed.
> “Look at the size of it—how could we miss?”

Ha’tak officers probably think they’ve hit the jackpot.
> “Finally! A _huge_ ship that doesn’t dodge or cloak!”

The Goa’uld ships unleashed their full fury.

Bright green plasma bolts and ion beams lashed across the void like the whips of vengeful gods. Pulse cannons pounded, and concentric shockwaves exploded across the _Vigilant Sky_’s position.

But the ship did not move.

**FIRST PRIME (startled)**:  
“My lord, it’s… still there. Still intact.”

**SOBEK (frowning)**:  
“Impossible. Not even a mothership could survive that barrage.”

They watched in growing disbelief as the Imperial warship—_nearly two kilometers of cathedral and iron_—hovered motionless, unshaken.

Its **void shields shimmered**, absorbing impact after impact with hissing distortion fields and blooming arcs of electromagnetic static. What few shots _did_ puncture the shielding struck its **adamantium hull**—each blast merely gouging scars across its flanged armor plates.

The _Vigilant Sky_ was not merely a ship. It was **a mobile fortress**, forged in the forges of Mars, sanctified by the Ecclesiarchy, and baptized in the blood of xenos.

**LORD-CAPTAIN GIHRAN (inspired)**:  
>“They think us slow. They think us tame.”

_He turned to the vox-helmsman._  

>“Bring us forward. Into their teeth.”

As the Goa’uld fleet reloaded, the _Vigilant Sky_ turned its prow, its plasma engines roaring to full burn. The massive vessel surged forward—**right into the heart of the Ha’tak formation**.

Sobek watches the *Vigilant Sky* slowly lumber forward like a floating cathedral of doom and sneers.

**SOBEK (blinking in disbelief)**:  
>“What… what fool in this galaxy fights like this?”

_He chuckled, shaking his head._  

>“Do they think we’ll just let them ram us?”

But the _Vigilant Sky_ did not attempt to ram.

It _positioned_.

As it came within **point-blank range**, broadside gun decks blossomed open like iron flowers. A wall of **macro-cannons**, **torpedo tubes**, and **plasma batteries** extended from the hull—each a cathedral unto itself.

The Goa’uld had never seen such a display. There were _hundreds_ of weapon batteries. Each one **larger than an Al’kesh bomber**.

**GIHRAN (with grim satisfaction)**:  
>“Let the Emperor's justice fall upon them like thunder. Full broadside. Fire.”

The _Vigilant Sky_ erupted.

Mass-reactive shells the size of trucks screamed into space. Torpedoes lanced forth like burning javelins. Macro-plasma bursts flared with sun-like brightness.

**The nearest Ha’tak took three volleys to the side. The hull folded in like wet paper.** Its shields collapsed, its engines ruptured, and within seconds, the entire vessel detonated into golden shards.

A glider-wing vaporized instantly under heavy bolter storms. Another Ha’tak was pierced stem to stern, the blast chain-reacting through its inner corridors.

Sobek’s amused arrogance shattered into horror.

**SOBEK (screaming)**:  
“Retreat! All vessels—break formation! Get to hyperspace, now!”

He turned to his First Prime.

**SOBEK (desperate)**:  
“Recall the fleet! We must—”

_An explosion tore through the bridge behind him._

The golden paneling buckled. Flames erupted from the control pylons. Sobek’s First Prime was vaporized instantly. Sobek’s scream was cut short as the blast consumed him.

On the _Vigilant Sky_, the auspex display flared with shrinking signatures—several Goa’uld ships fleeing into hyperspace, the rest tumbling wreckage.

**GIHRAN (quietly)**:  
*“And so ends the usurper Sobek. May your corpse drift cold among the false stars.”*

He turned from the display, hands clasped behind his back.

**GIHRAN (to bridge crew)**:  
“Begin recovery sweep. Signal the surface: the skies are ours.”

_Scene ends with the wreckage of Sobek’s command Ha’tak drifting, split open like a golden fruit, its fragments joining the orbital graveyard of a new era._

## **📜 Khensu's Ontological Breakdown**

**Location:** *Cell 07-A, Fort Sanctus Veritus, Abydos Prime*  
**Subject:** *Khensu, former System Lord, detained*

Khensu lies on a cold, metal bench in his dimly lit cell. The smooth sandstone walls and gold accents of his former palace now feel like memories from another life. A single **auspex-halo projector** hums in the ceiling, casting radiant, filtered holos into the cell.

**Imperial propaganda** plays on loop—again.

> *“The God-Emperor is the protector of mankind, the flame in the dark, the architect of civilization. His light spreads from Holy Terra, through the stars, to worlds long forgotten.”*

Footage rolls by: soaring citadels on forge worlds; planetary governors swearing oaths beneath cathedral-spires; titanic statues of the Emperor being raised by entire legions of compliant former slaves—once property of System Lords, now clad in Imperial drab, proudly chanting the Emperor’s name.

Khensu, once a System Lord, clenches his fists—then unclenches them.

He murmurs to himself.

> “They believe… so completely. So *utterly.*”

He stares into the holo showing **Holy Terra’s** skyline—a world-city stretching across an entire globe, stained in gold and flame.

> “Tau’ri never built such monuments. Never commanded such loyalty. Even Ra, for all his flair, never instilled such... obedience.”

Another scene: Kriegers leading former Jaffa in salute, teaching them the Imperial Creed, fitting them with new uniforms, handing them copies of the *Imperial Infantryman’s Uplifting Primer.*

> “They were... slaves... just like mine. But they rose up *without armies.* Just broadcasts. *Words.*”

Khensu shudders. Not from cold—but from creeping doubt. The kind of doubt he once punished in others.

He speaks aloud, as if trying to anchor himself:

> “We are gods. We *were* gods. The Ancients gave us the gates, and the humans bowed before us.”

The projector shifts.

> *“The Goa’uld are liars. Parasites upon the body of mankind. They wear stolen skin, wield stolen fire, and declare themselves divine. Their time is over.”*

Khensu trembles.

> “...Are we truly gods… if a greater god comes and finds us wanting?”

The cell remains silent.

But within Khensu’s mind, the echo continues.

The walls flicker again. The **tiled fresco of Holy Terra** appears—**golden spires**, **hive cathedrals** rising above clouds, the **Imperial Palace** an impossible silhouette carved into the mountain of Earth itself.

Khensu, now thinner, humbled, his ornate golden armor tarnished, sits cross-legged beneath the speakers.

> *“Ten thousand years of vigilance. Ten thousand years of sacrifice. The God-Emperor guards mankind from the shadows of the warp, from the xeno, the heretic, and the mutant. He sits upon the Golden Throne of Terra, beacon of the Astronomican, Master of Mankind…”*

He watches in silence.

Then he **whispers aloud**, voice tinged with awe and fear:

> **Khensu:**  
> “Not Tau’ri... Terra. This is no tribal rebellion, no rogue dynasty. This is something... older. Vaster. Refined by war, fire, and devotion. We—System Lords—we played at godhood with scraps of another’s design. And now... the builders have returned.”

He shakes his head slowly.

> “No Goa’uld—no matter how bold—could forge cities like these. We merely inherited ruin and ruled by deception. But these Imperials… they *believe*. And worse, they make *others* believe.”

A final image: **the God-Emperor’s statue**, a thousand meters tall, overlooking a billion-strong parade of human soldiers.

> **Khensu (quietly):**  
> “We are not gods. And they… they have slain far greater things than us.”

Alone in his cell, dimly lit by red lumen strips, **Khensu** stares up at the pict-screen.

He has not slept in days.

**Footage plays**, over and over:
- Goa’uld Ha’tak vessels exploding like dying suns.
- **Black-armored giants** storming through golden gates.
- A line of slaves falling to their knees as an Imperial banner is planted in their city square.
- The chanting of Ecclesiarchal priests, praising the **God-Emperor of Mankind**, their faces rapturous.

He clenches his fists, then lets them go limp.

> “They are not Tau’ri,” he mutters aloud.  
> “They are not like *us*. These humans are something else.”

> “They worship a *corpse*, yet they conquer like gods.”  
> “Their empire is… old. *Ancient.* Not stolen—*built.*”

A recording plays on loop—**Marcus Vrangell’s broadcast**:

> *“You have claimed the legacy of humanity as your own, parasite. You have desecrated the architectures of our ancestors. But we have returned. And we bring fire.”*

Khensu lowers his head. For the first time, the words wound.

He flashes back to **Ra**—how they took human slaves and tech from the Ancients, posturing as gods, ruling like children in the halls of grown men.

But now?

Now the *grown men* have returned.

> “It was all a lie…” he whispers.  
> “We were never gods. We were… children playing with dead men's tools.”

He looks at the pict-screen again.

And for the first time in thousands of years, **a System Lord feels shame**.

And dread.

## **🎖️ Address by Commissar Marcus Vrangell**

**Location:** *Parade Square, Forward Bastion Karnos*

Hundreds of **Krieger Guardsmen** stand at attention, flanked by roaring **Hydra Flak tanks** and **Vostroyan banners**. In the distance, captured **Goa’uld banners burn**, their snake-like emblems dissolving into ash.

Commissar Marcus Vrangell, now a hero of three liberated worlds, ascends the dais.

> **Commissar Vrangell (voice thundering):**
>  
> “Brothers of the Imperium! What we face is no glorious adversary! No peer civilization! The Goa’uld are parasites—leeches—feeding on the forgotten flesh of our ancestors!”

The crowd remains silent—reverent.

> “They took what the Dark Age of Technology gave us! *Our* gateways, *our* machines, *our* science—and they dressed them in lies and crowns! They masquerade as gods, enslaving our lost cousins across the stars!”

He slams a gloved fist into his chest.

> “But they were not ready for us. For *you*! For the Emperor’s wrath made manifest!”

Cheers now.

> “What they call 'divinity' is cowardice! Their worlds—petty feudal fiefdoms held by fear and illusion—crumble at our touch! Their Jaffa are not warriors. They are drones! Their cities, pastiches of Terra’s glory!”

He looks toward the heavens.

> “The Emperor did not forget the lost. He sent *us*. And we shall reclaim every soul, every stone, every secret *they* defiled.”

The soldiers erupt.

> “FOR TERRA!”  
> “FOR THE EMPEROR!”  
> “DEATH TO THE PARASITES!”

### **🏛 Scene 2: The High Lords of Terra Convene — The Golden Flame Spreads**  
*Location: The Imperial Palace, Terra – Hall of the Lords Militant*

A chamber of awe and eternity. Dust never dares settle here. Vast pillars stretch into a ceiling lost in shadow, where hololithic maps of the galaxy shimmer in real-time. The scent of incense and machine oil wafts as robed *servo-cherubs* flutter silently.

Seated upon obsidian thrones—wreathed in golden trim—are the **High Lords of Terra**.

A servitor clicks, presenting the compiled reports of **Commissar Marcus Vrangell**, now titled **Proconsul of the Gatefront Crusade**.

**High Admiral Semion Benthos** rises first.

> “The Stargate Crusade progresses beyond expectation. Seventeen gate-worlds have fallen to Imperial control. The Goa’uld’s Jaffa legions have been shattered. Their ha’tak warships reduced to wreckage and relics.”

> “One such vessel, Khensu's, has yielded *Dark Age of Technology salvage*, now under Mechanicus purification and reverse-archival at Mars-Theta Nine.”

**Eccleisarch Kalistor** speaks next, fingers steepled.

> “More miraculous still, are the *souls reclaimed*. Entire worlds of once-enslaved humans have risen to greet our faith. Upon receiving broadcasts of His Radiance, they threw down their false gods—*before our boots even touched soil.*”

He pauses, triumphant.

> “These liberated peoples now chant the Emperor’s name. They erect shrines. Chant creeds. Request enforcers, preachers, and quotas. They *compete* for the right to house His effigy.”

A Vox-magi plays a transmission from one such world: peasants weeping with joy as a golden statue of the Emperor is unveiled in their village square, choirboys singing the Imperial Hymn.

**Grand Provost Olvera** adds:

> “Reports suggest that these former Goa’uld slaves are *more compliant* than many Imperial citizens. Some already volunteer for labor tithes. Their previous conditioning… was extensive. Our propaganda simply re-channeled it.”

**Lord Inquisitor Vallan**, shadowy and half-glimpsed in his cowl, gives his final analysis:

> “The Goa’uld must be viewed not merely as xenos, but as *viral memes*. A cultural and biological parasite that took root in human colonies abandoned by the Dark Age collapse.”

> “This crusade is not just conquest—it is exorcism.”

Silence falls.

**The Lord Commander Militant of the Astra Militarum** stands. He bows his head in solemnity—and then intones:

> “Let it be known. The God-Emperor’s Light has pierced yet another veil of darkness. The Gatefront Crusade shall continue until the last false god is extinguished.”

All present nod.

Above them, the stars flicker.

Below them, a billion guardsmen prepare to march.

## 📜 The Mechanicus Recover Goa’uld Technology in Orbit

**Location**: Orbit of Abydos Primus, Imperial salvage vessel *Lex Mechanicus*, accompanied by Adeptus Mechanicus voidships  
**Characters**: Magos Explorator Rhox, Tech-Priests, Servitors, Data-Scribes

The blackness of space is pierced by the sprawling wreckage of shattered Ha’tak warships. Gleaming chunks of alien alloys drift amidst drifting plasma fires, surrounded by an eerie glow of residual energy.

The *Lex Mechanicus*, a colossal ship festooned with mechanized arms and scanning arrays, floats silently among the debris. Its crimson-vested crew moves methodically, guided by the hum of cogitators and chanting of binary liturgies.

**Magos Rhox**, clad in ceramite robes etched with sacred cogwheel sigils, intones in a voice part prayer, part command:

> “By the Omnissiah’s grace, we shall reclaim these relics of the Dark Age. Let none of the unclean xeno-machines escape our sanctified scrutiny.”

He gestures to a team of Tech-Priests and servitors, who activate articulated manipulators and power tools.

**Data-Scribe Valerius** activates a vox-feed:

> “Scanning shows multiple hull breaches in primary hulls, but many systems remain operational. Energy signatures consistent with non-Imperial warp drives—fascinating.”

A servitor with ocular implants carefully pries open a damaged Ha’tak’s armory hatch. Inside lie weapon banks etched with alien glyphs, their barrels blackened but still humming faintly with residual power.

**Tech-Priest Icarus** notes:

> “Plasma lances and energy projectors unlike anything in the Lexmechanicum catalog. Unknown power sources, yet oddly compatible with our basic arc reactors. This is the forbidden knowledge we seek.”

The Magos turns to a console displaying schematics reconstructed from fragments:

> “These devices—once thought mere superstition, ‘god-tech’ of the xenos—are indeed relics of human ingenuity from the Dark Age of Technology, corrupted and repurposed by these parasitic Goa’uld. The Imperium’s heritage is twisted, but not lost.”

Tech-Priests debate the ethical implications:

> “Should we endeavor to replicate these devices? Or destroy them to deny the heretics their power?”

> “The Omnissiah guides us. Knowledge is sacred, but must be purified before use.”

Nearby, servitors transport intact Goa’uld power cores into containment fields, humming softly as energy pulses inside.

**Magos Rhox**, eyes glowing behind lenses:

> “Each recovered artifact brings us closer to unraveling the true extent of the xeno-taint. The Stargate itself—our first prize—now confirmed as Dark Age relic, and these armaments confirm the Goa’uld’s heresy.”

## 📜 Mechanicus Reverse-Engineering Goa’uld Technology

**Location**: *Lex Mechanicus* Salvage Bay and Research Labs, Orbit of Abydos Primus  
**Characters**: Magos Rhox, Tech-Priests, Enginseers, Data-Scribes, Servitors

The clang of power tools and the hum of arc welders fill the cavernous salvage bay, where disassembled Goa’uld weaponry and starship components lie strewn across vats of ancient alloy and hololithic schematics flicker in suspended holo-projectors.

**Magos Rhox** stands over a gleaming plasma lance barrel, its alien curves a puzzle to be unlocked:

> “Observe the crystal lattice configuration—self-replenishing energy matrices. A marvel of Dark Age science, warped by xeno design but fundamentally human in origin.”

He gestures to a cadre of Enginseers wielding servo-arms and nano-solderers:

> “Begin integration trials. Adapt plasma lance output to the Adeptus Mechanicus standard power conduits. We must harness this ‘divine flame’ for the glory of the Omnissiah.”

Nearby, **Tech-Priest Dominus Valex** scrutinizes a Goa’uld power core encased in containment fields:

> “Power density exceeds standard archeotech capacitors by over thirty percent. Caution: core is unstable and bio-reactive. Containment fields must remain calibrated.”

A servitor obediently adjusts fields while chanting binary canticles.

In the adjacent laboratory, **Data-Scribe Sybilla** overlays Imperial ballistic schematics with alien designs:

> “Preliminary tests indicate Goa’uld disruptor weaponry can be modified to interface with standard Imperial targeting arrays. Potential to greatly increase infantry lethality, especially for Krieger Guardsmen and Astartes alike.”

Magos Rhox, eyes gleaming with fervor behind his ocular implants, intones:

> “This is the dawning of a new era—one where the heretical spoils of our enemies become the sacred tools of our Emperor’s vengeance. The Mechanicus shall purge their taint and elevate their secrets.”

The lab fills with energized technicians and illuminated cogitators working tirelessly, crafting prototype disruptor rifles, power gauntlets, and energy shielding devices, blending Imperial gothic aesthetics with alien engineering.

**Enginseer Brottus** approaches Magos Rhox with a report:

> “Preliminary field tests on Naquadah-enhanced plasma capacitors show a thirty-seven percent increase in discharge efficiency. Potential application in heavy bolters and void shields.”

Magos Rhox nods approvingly:

> “Excellent. Prepare units for deployment on the next crusade fleet. Let the enemies of mankind tremble before our new fire.”

#### **Closing**:  

The *Lex Mechanicus* beams raw data back to Terra, where the High Lords of Terra eagerly await the fruits of this mechanized excavation.

The Mechanicus rejoice in the rediscovery of lost human technology and prepare to integrate what they can into the Imperium’s war effort, readying the next phase of the **Stargate Crusade**.

As the Mechanicus reverse-engineers and repurposes Goa’uld technologies, the Imperium’s military might grows exponentially, preparing to crush the xeno parasite civilization once and for all with weapons forged from their own stolen legacy.
