On a rocky mountainous planet somewhere in the galaxy, Stormtroopers from the Galactic Empire step through the Stargate. Seeing no signs of hostility, they make camp near the stargate. Unbenowst to them, the Kriegers from the Imperium of Man have also set up camp not too far away, but they don't know it yet. In the morning soldiers from both armies head down to the stream to get some water and bump into each other on accident. They start talking.

Soldiers from each group ask the other whom they serve, and hear as an answer "the Emperor, of course!" Initially they feel suspicious, but soon ignore any red flags, because they are both soldiers in uniform and in an empire of that size, there could be regiments with strange uniforms. Hillarity ensues as soldiers from both groups mistake the others for their comrades, befriending each other. Not asking too many questions about who this "Emperor" is exactly and relying on assumptions to clear any misunderstandings, thus preventing a battle because of their ignorance.

**Dawn**

The mountain winds blew cold across craggy stone. Two camps, tucked behind outcroppings, unknowingly shared the same valley. One bore the sterile white tents and sleek tech of the **Galactic Empire**, recently arrived through the Stargate, scouting for rebel hideouts or exploitable resources. The other, half a kilometer east, was a grim arrangement of camouflaged dugouts, barbed wire, and devotional skull shrines: a **Krieger detachment** of the **Imperium of Man**, mapping potential crusade routes.

Neither knew of the other. Yet.

**Scene: The Stream**

A squad of **Stormtroopers** approached the stream, bucket in hand, helmets fogging from their breath.

At the same time, a pair of **Death Korps of Krieg Guardsmen**, gasmasks hissing, emerged from the opposite brush.

All six froze.

Weapons were not raised—yet. They simply stared at each other through visors and lenses.

One Stormtrooper spoke first, cautious:

> “Hey. You guys with...uh, the Empire?”

The Krieger, after a pause, rasped through his filter:

> “Of course. We serve the Emperor.”

A beat.  
The Stormtrooper nodded. “Same here. Praise the Emperor.”

The Kriegers, who had never heard that specific phrase before, assumed it was a standard local blessing.

> “Praise be.”

Another beat.

The Stormtrooper gestured at the bucket.

> “Water’s clearer over there. You guys go ahead.”

“Affirmative,” replied the Krieger. “Imperial courtesy is most appreciated.”

The Stormtrooper gave him a thumbs-up. The Krieger returned a stiff salute. Neither noticed the strange accent, the unusual uniform pattern, or the odd choice of sidearm.

> “By the way, my name's James”, said the Stormtrooper, “what's yours?”

> “Mine is Hans!” Replied the Krieger

---

**Later That Morning**

More soldiers trickled into the area—engineers, medics, mess-tent staff. Over the next few hours, a strange mutual camp emerged organically. Stormtroopers and Kriegers sat near fires, exchanged ration bars, and grunted about mud quality and helmet fogging.

A Stormtrooper noted:

> “Haven’t seen that pattern of armor before. Must be one of the regional regiments.”

“Segmentum-issue,” the Krieger lied, without blinking.

Meanwhile, a Krieger asked:

> “Where is your devotional purity seal?”

“Huh? Oh. Probably issued on another world. Logistics, you know?”

Both sides sipped recycled caffeine and shared tales of long service, suppressing rebels, exterminating xenos, and following orders from their beloved Emperor.

**The Conversation That Nearly Ruined Everything**

It happened around the fire.

A Krieger sergeant, offering a toast, exclaimed:

> “Long Live the God-Emperor of Mankind!”

A young Stormtrooper, replied:

> “Our Emperor is indeed the ruler of all humanity. But wouldn't it be a stretch to call Palpatine a god?”

The Krieger stiffened.

> “Palpatine who?”

The Stormtrooper responded:

> “Yeah. The Emperor. You know. The old guy in the cloak?”

The Krieger blinked slowly behind his mask.

> “I didn't know he had a name. But of course Our Emperor is ancient. He has been Our Sovreign for over ten thousand years.”

A pause.  
Another Stormtrooper chuckled nervously.

> “Wait... ten thousand?”

>“…Yes.”

They all looked at each other. Confused. Uncertain.

Then a Stormtrooper shrugged.

> “Hey, galactic timelines are weird. You serve an Emperor, we serve an Emperor, right? Bureaucracy’s probably just messed up the records.”

“Affirmative,” said the Krieger, whose idea of cross-cultural engagement was normally bayoneting.

They all went back to drinking recaff.

**Building Suspicions**

That evening, an **Imperial Commissar** passed near the stream and saw Stormtroopers cooking sausages alongside Kriegers, one of whom was teaching a Stormtrooper how to recite the Litany of Endurance. He opened his mouth to shout treason—until a Stormtrooper offered him a canteen of brandy and said,

> “To the Emperor!”

The Commissar narrowed his eyes. “Which Emperor?”

The Stormtrooper beamed.

> “The one we all serve, obviously!”

The Commissar paused, calculating, then grunted:

> “Very well. Carry on.”

He took the brandy.

**Thus was the Battle of Emperor's Rift avoided.**

Through shared titles, ignorance, and mutual hatred of rebels, two vast empires brushed against one another—and, against all odds, did not immediately go to war.

For now.

**Title: “Mistaken Empires”**  
**Scene: The Officer’s Parley**  
**Location: Rocky Planet – The Campfire Summit, 1 Day After First Contact**

**Opening**

The fires had burned through the night.

Stormtroopers of the **Galactic Empire** and Guardsmen of the **Imperium of Man** had continued their uneasy-but-cheerful camaraderie. Shared rations, shared complaints. Each believed the other to be some obscure outpost or fringe regiment of _their own_ respective Empire—"odd armor, strange lingo, but probably loyal."

But now, dawn brought formalities.

From both sides, **officers** had been summoned to resolve _“administrative irregularities.”_

From the Galactic Empire:

- **Lieutenant Cass Vaylen**, Imperial Navy liaison.
- **Captain Nor Dural**, Stormtrooper officer.

From the Imperium:

- **Commissar Mark Vrangell**, with two servitor-scribes and a portable incense burner.
- **Magos Logister Tertullian Rhox**, whirring and clicking, accompanied by a servo-skull.

They met in a rocky clearing, at a long fold-out table someone had scavenged. The moment was tense.

---

**The Meeting Begins**

Lt. Vaylen leaned forward.

> “First off, I want to commend your men on their discipline. I must say, I’ve never seen stormtroopers so... traditional. That Gothic armor, those... skulls. Is that local fashion?”

Commissar Vrangell scowled.

> “You are mistaken. These are not stormtroopers. These are guardsmen of the Death Korps of Krieg, loyal sons of Holy Terra, defenders of the Imperium of Man.”

Captain Dural blinked.

> “Wait. Holy Terra? As in... Coruscant?”

Magos Rhox’s vox-grille buzzed.

> “Negative. _Terra Primaris_, Segmentum Solar. Cradle of Mankind. Seated within the Galactic Core.”

Lt. Vaylen laughed awkwardly.

> “You’re kidding. There’s no human core worlds. The Core is filled with gravitational anomalies. Nobody can settle there.”

Commissar Vrangell stood, nostrils flaring.

> “HERESY. The light of the God-Emperor has shone from Terra for over ten thousand years.”

Captain Dural narrowed his eyes.

> “Ten thousand? That’s... that’s absurd. The Galactic Empire was founded less than thirty years ago!”

_Click._ A servo-skull hovered ominously behind him.

---

**The Realization Sets In**

A long silence.

Vaylen ran a hand down his face.

> “Wait... wait. Are you saying you’re from an _entirely different human empire_?”

Magos Rhox’s mechadendrites twitched.

> “Analysis suggests alternate lineages. Parallel human civilizational development. Shared genetic origin… but divergent histories.”

Commissar Vrangell grunted.

> “Clearly descended from ancient colonists who forgot their loyalty to the Throne.”

Captain Dural turned to Vaylen.

> “Sir, I don’t think we’re dealing with some backwater. Their soldiers fought orks.”

Vaylen whispered:

> “What’s an ork?”

Rhox opened a holo-display: footage of a greenskin WAAAGH ravaging a hiveworld. Vaylen turned pale.

---

**The Accusations Begin**

The silence returned, thick now with tension. The crackling of the nearby cookfire and the gentle chirps of native rock-hoppers echoed faintly across the ridge.

Then the accusations began.

**Commissar Vrangell**, jaw clenched, eyes glowing with righteous Imperial fury:

> “This is worse than I feared. Not only are you heretics, you are traitors. Descendants of the Long Night, perhaps? Your false 'Emperor' is a pretender—your 'Empire' a blasphemy built on arrogance and ignorance.”

**Lt. Vaylen**, voice sharp, fingers drifting to his sidearm:

> “*We* are the rightful heirs of galactic order. You dare accuse the Empire of treason? You don't know what you're talking about! You are insane! We bring peace and unity to the galaxy, not skulls and incense!”

**Captain Dural** stepped back, eyes darting to Rhox’s ominous mechadendrites:

> “This is getting out of hand.”

**Rhox**, calm and clinical, monotoned through his vox-grille:

> “Threat assessment recalibrating. Probability of ideological schism: 99.97%. Recommend strategic withdrawal or immediate extermination protocol.”

**Vrangell**, unslinging his bolt pistol with a hiss of intent:

> “I *knew* there was something off about your helmets. No aquilas, no purity seals. Explain yourselves, mutants!”

**Vaylen**, drawing his blaster:

> “If anyone’s a mutant, it’s your machine priest over there! He looks like he lost a wrestling match with a junk droid.”

**Dural**, getting between the two officers, raising both hands:

> “We’re not doing this here!”

---

**Backing Away**

Weapons drawn, but no shots fired—yet—the officers circled each other slowly, backing away toward their respective camps. Dust kicked up underfoot. The tension could have cut ceramite.

As they crested the ridge, still staring each other down over raised weapons, they found themselves suddenly surrounded… by mingling troops.

**Kriegers and stormtroopers**, sitting together around the same fires. Sharing rations. Trading helmet polishing techniques. Playing a grim variation of sabacc with painted Krieg ration cards.

One Krieger, voice filtered and flat, offered a stick of lho to a stormtrooper.

“**For the Emperor**,” the stormtrooper said with a shrug, accepting it.

“For the Emperor,” the Krieger replied through his rebreather.

Both officers froze.

**Vrangell, horrified**:

> “They’ve fraternized.”

**Vaylen, equally horrified**:

> “They think they’re in the same army!”

---

**Frantic Orders**

Within moments, both sides were barking orders.

> “Kriegers! Fall back to deployment pattern Aurex-9! Helmets on! Weapons ready! Avoid contact with suspected heretics!”

> “Stormtroopers! Rally to gridpoint Theta. Withdraw from contact. Let’s not make this worse!”

Both officers got the usual reaction:

>blink-blink

The mingling soldiers looked around in confusion as vox-casters buzzed and officers shouted conflicting orders. A few began backing away awkwardly, unsure of which “Emperor” their newfound friends served. The rest genuinely did not know what was going on.

> “Are we being attacked? By whom? Where's the enemy? I don't see no enemy here.”

Both Vrangell and Vaylen tried to separate their soldiers from those of their counterpart. Shaking men by the shoulder, as if to wake them up from a deep trance. Frantically running around and shouting, both officers bumped into each other on more than one occasion, tripping over backpacks, ammunition crates, and water buckets, barely holding onto their hats!

The whole shared camp erupted into a chaotic frenzy, soldiers grabbing belongings in a hurry, lest they be punished by their commander. A Krieger grabbed a E-11 blaster rifle. A Stormtrooper frantically grabbed a lasgun and some corpse-starch rations. Another stormtrooper panicking, not being able to find his misplaced helmet, donned a Krieger helmet with gas mask that happened to be under his hand at the time. Soldiers from both sides mistakenly grabbed the weapons, goods, rations, and equipment of the other side that were casually shared just moments prior. Kriegers were ripping apart tents with bayonets, Stormtroopers knocking over makeshift wooden tables. The whole scene resembled two merged galaxies struggling to untangle themselves from each other's mutual embrace.

---

**Back to the Ridges**

Within an hour, the shared campfire was abandoned.

From opposite ridges, the two forces re-formed into tight military formations, watching each other through scopes and auspex arrays. A new coldness had descended over the rocky world.

Only the native rock-hoppers remained, chirping curiously among abandoned mess tins and firepits.

---

**Commissar Vrangell’s Vox-Log, Entry 328.49/Ω:**

> “Subject: First confirmed contact with unknown human polity calling itself the ‘Galactic Empire.’ Uniformity of species confirmed, ideological loyalty *not*. High likelihood of genetic origin from unrecorded diaspora. Assessment: Heretical fringe remnant, highly advanced in void engineering, low psychic activity. Recommend future engagement protocols include immediate Inquisitorial review.”

**Lt. Vaylen’s Report to Imperial High Command:**

> “Encountered anomalous Imperial-style force calling themselves ‘the Imperium of Man.’ Extreme religious tendencies, primitive yet baroque technology, disturbingly efficient ground forces. Recommend containment until more data is available. Potential rival... or potential threat.”
