**Imperial Palace, Coruscant — Secure Strategic Briefing Room**

*Present: Emperor Palpatine, Lord Vader, Grand Moff Tarkin, and select members of the Imperial Intelligence Bureau.*

> **[A holoprojector flickers to life, replaying snippets of the Imperium of Man’s recent propaganda transmissions denouncing the Concord.]**
>  
> *"...A pale-skinned, long-haired xeno-sorcerer who speaks of 'harmony' and 'paths of peace' while orchestrating attacks on Imperial convoys..."*  
> *"...a unity of rot, of decay, of surrender..."*  
> *"...They are the serpent in the garden..."*

---

**Emperor Palpatine** *(seated in shadow)*:  
*“Hmmm... delusions wrapped in fanaticism. The rhetoric of a regime rotting from within. It is astonishing they have not devoured themselves yet.”*

**Grand Moff Tarkin** *(arms behind back, standing upright)*:  
“Indeed, Your Excellency. I’ve reviewed the full cache of intercepted transmissions. The Imperium’s propaganda is... florid. Poetic, in the way a firestorm might be. But rational? No. They describe trees that think, warriors who dream attacks into reality, and ships made of *wood*. Frankly—if not for the clear indications of galactic-scale industrial power—I would have dismissed the entire Imperium as a deranged cult surviving off pre-AI superstition.”

**Darth Vader** *(voice low and mechanical)*:  
“They are powerful. That makes them dangerous, no matter how mad. Their so-called God-Emperor is a psychic presence felt across the stars. If he *is* dead, then what guides the warp-beacon they call the Astronomican?”  
*“They bind loyalty through fear and faith. It reminds me of the Sith of old.”*

---

**Palpatine** *(smiling thinly)*:  
“Yes, Lord Vader. Fear sustains empires... until the fear turns inward. That is their weakness. The Imperium is a corpse that rules through ritual, not reason. It survives by inertia, not vision. There is no room for innovation—only stagnation ossified into religion.”

---

**Tarkin** *(nodding curtly)*:  
“Then what of the Concord? Primitive, certainly. But their hit-and-run methods are reportedly effective against even the Imperium’s bulk. Their technology is strange—organic, even absurd—but clever. Their ideology, though, that’s the danger.”

**Palpatine**:  
*“Ideology?”*

**Tarkin**:  
“Yes, my lord. Their message spreads like a *meme-virus*. Reject augmentation. Embrace nature. Harmony over conquest. It’s the sort of rot that eats at the spine of a modern civilization. Especially appealing to weak minds searching for ‘authenticity.’”  
“They claim to predict the Imperium’s every move. I suspect some blend of low-level psychic phenomena and primitive heuristics—clever, but no substitute for force projection.”

---

**Vader** *(ominous tone)*:  
“They are not Jedi. But they are not without power. Illusions. Projection. Intuition. Perhaps even access to forgotten aspects of the Force—fragmented and filtered through their philosophies.”

---

**Palpatine** *(quietly)*:  
“They hide behind trees, but see much. Curious.”

---

**Tarkin**:  
“What action shall we take, Emperor? The Concord is ideologically opposed to technological imperialism. They will not respond to our usual diplomatic overtures. The Imperium, on the other hand, is so wrapped in superstition that alliance is nearly unthinkable.”

---

**Palpatine**:  
“We watch. We wait. Let the corpse-empire and the tree-rats bleed one another. Meanwhile... we will make contact with these *Federation* travelers. Rationality may yet be found among *them*.”

*He rises slowly, robes whispering like shadows.*

> **“And if the Concord wishes to play at prophecy, let us show them the future. A future shaped by *our* will. Not nature. Not fate. Not gods. Only... Order.”**

*The three figures remain in shadowed silence for a moment before Palpatine turns back to the holoscreen.*

---

**Palpatine**:  
“There is one name that recurs in the reports and transmissions — Ashtar Sheran. The supposed leader or ideological beacon of the Concord. A Nordic figure, towering and radiant. The Imperium vilifies him, but our intelligence remains scant.”

---

**Vader**:  
“I have sensed whispers. This Ashtar Sheran is said to possess abilities beyond the usual—telepathic projection, mastery of astral realms, some form of non-technological teleportation. Such powers would unsettle even the most disciplined psykers of the Imperium.”

---

**Tarkin** *(skeptical)*:  
“Stories from propaganda rarely hold much truth. They paint him as a ‘godlike’ figure, but such exaggerations are expected. Yet, if these claims have merit, it would explain why the Concord eludes Imperial grasp.”

---

**Palpatine**:  
“Indeed. His influence seems both spiritual and strategic. The Concord’s resistance, their unpredictable tactics—these cannot be merely military. It is said that Ashtar Sheran’s presence unites disparate species and ideologies into a single cause, something our divide-and-conquer methods have failed to break.”

---

**Vader** *(considering)*:  
“He may be a focus of psychic strength, a nexus of the Concord’s collective will. A living symbol of their unity. If so, targeting him could unravel their cohesion.”

---

**Tarkin**:  
“But be warned. The Imperium’s reports claim his powers extend beyond physical form—perhaps capable of astral projection, or existing simultaneously in multiple planes. Conventional strikes would be ineffective.”

---

**Palpatine** *(smiling coldly)*:  
“A fascinating puzzle. We must increase our surveillance, deploy more subtle agents. The Federation may yet be useful in this. If Ashtar Sheran is truly as powerful as suggested, understanding him could tip the scales in this galactic contest.”

---

**Vader** *(nodding)*:  
“Agreed. He is a threat not just to our forces, but to the very order we impose. He represents an ideology—one that challenges control through unity rather than domination.”

---

**Palpatine** *(finalizing)*:  
“Prepare dossiers on Ashtar Sheran and the Concord. Let no stone remain unturned. The galaxy’s fate will hinge on knowledge—and power.”

*(The chamber falls into a tense silence, the shadow of Ashtar Sheran looming large even in the distant halls of Imperial command.)*

**Galactic Empire Dossier: Ashtar Sheran & The Concord**

---

**CLASSIFICATION:** TOP SECRET — EYES ONLY  
**ISSUED BY:** Imperial Intelligence Directorate  
**SUBJECT:** Ashtar Sheran — Leader and Ideologue of the Concord  
**DATE:** Galactic Standard Year 4322

---

### I. Overview

Ashtar Sheran is identified as the preeminent figurehead and spiritual leader of the Concord, a multi-species confederation residing in the galactic core region. The Concord represents a unique anomaly in the current galactic order—eschewing industrial technology in favor of organic bioships, psychic augmentation, and spiritual unity.

---

### II. Physical Description and Capabilities

- **Appearance:** Approximately 8 feet tall; Nordic features; golden hair; striking azure eyes; snow-white skin.
- **Known Powers:**  
  - Astral projection and non-technological teleportation (“etheric projection”)  
  - Profound psychic abilities enabling telepathic communication over vast distances  
  - Mentor and symbolic unifier of diverse species within the Concord  
  - Tactical genius in guerrilla warfare against Imperium forces

---

### III. The Concord’s Philosophy and Society

- A fusion of spiritual idealism and organic technology, rejecting machine dominance.
- Multi-species alliance includes Pleiadians (mentat seers), Saiyans (warrior caste), Elves (psychic mentors), and Ninja clans (psychic infiltrators).
- Emphasis on living in harmony with nature and the universe, opposing technological overreach and Imperial dogma.
- Uses biological starships bonded to their pilots, functioning as symbiotic living entities.
- Society structured around intuition, psychic connection, and communal survival rather than rigid hierarchy.

---

### IV. Military Capabilities

- Employs hit-and-run tactics exploiting advanced psychic espionage and guerrilla warfare.
- Uses living bioships capable of near-undetectable stealth approaches to disable enemy propulsion systems.
- Saiyan warriors wield overwhelming psychic energy, capable of vaporizing terrain.
- Ninja units deploy psychic illusion and subversion techniques to sow confusion and panic.
- Exceptional ability to predict and counter Imperial fleet movements, attributed to mentat computation and psychic foresight.

---

### V. Strategic Threat Assessment

- **Operational Unpredictability:** The Concord’s tactics and psychic abilities undermine Imperial assumptions of order and control.
- **Psychic Influence:** Ashtar Sheran’s abilities and the Concord’s collective psychic strength present novel threats to Imperial psyker dominance.
- **Ideological Contamination:** Their anti-Imperial, neo-Luddite, and spiritual philosophy threatens to erode the obedience enforced by the Cult Imperialis.
- **Potential for Alliance:** While currently hostile, the Federation’s interest in the Concord could reshape galactic alliances, complicating Imperial efforts.

---

### VI. Known Imperial Intelligence Gaps

- The full extent of Ashtar Sheran’s psychic powers remains unknown.
- The exact nature of Concord bioship technology defies current Imperial scientific comprehension.
- The psychological and metaphysical foundations of the Concord’s resistance are poorly understood.

---

### VII. Recommended Actions

- Intensify surveillance and infiltration efforts focused on psychic and metaphysical domains.
- Develop countermeasures against psychic and organic technologies.
- Exploit potential ideological fissures within the Concord’s multi-species alliance.
- Monitor Federation involvement closely, especially regarding technology or diplomatic exchanges.
- Avoid direct confrontation without overwhelming force; favor attrition and subversion tactics.

---

**Summary:**  
Ashtar Sheran and the Concord represent a significant and unconventional challenge to the Imperial order. Their fusion of psychic powers, organic technology, and spiritual philosophy complicates standard military and political responses. Continued research and cautious engagement are essential to maintaining Imperial dominance in the galaxy.

**Aboard the *T'au'n Bork'an'Ti'Ro* (Wisdom of Bork'an’s Eye)**  
**Encrypted Strategic Conference — Command Deck Level, Sept Bork’an**  
**Participants: Commander Kor’el Bork’an Mal’keth, Ethereal Aun’Vre Sali, Earth Caste Engineers, Water Caste Diplomats**

---

> **[Imperial propaganda transmission plays on loop in the background, heavily filtered and translated:]**  
> *"...these tree-dwelling heretics corrupt the minds of mankind with their whispers of unity with the xeno and the soil... They are the Concord — a nest of sedition, psychic corruption, and unnatural communion with the unclean. Beware their sorcery. Burn their arks. Purge their roots!"*

---

### **Kor’el Mal’keth** *(arms crossed, flicking his tail in agitation)*:  
*“They really hate trees.”*

---

### **Aun’Vre Sali** *(serene but firm)*:  
“Their hatred stems not from reason, but from fear. The Imperium labels all deviation as heresy. They see the Concord as both ideologically subversive and strategically elusive. That makes them dangerous in Imperial eyes.”

---

### **Fio’El Tor’vas (Earth Caste)** *(scrolling through data on the Concord bioships)*:  
“What I do not understand is *how* those ships function. The materials aren’t metallic — at least, not conventionally. They appear to be... grown. We suspect they are semi-sentient vessels. They don't emit standard emissions signatures. Perfect for stealth operations. But that violates multiple known principles of thermodynamics. Unless... they’re *alive.*”

---

### **Por’El Doran (Water Caste Diplomat)**:  
“According to what we’ve seen, the Concord follows no unified industrial design. Their society is a fusion — agrarian elves, psychic warriors, telepathic humans. It’s not a government in the way we understand it. It’s... a culture of cultures. Bound not by economics or caste, but a shared metaphysical worldview. Harmony with nature — and rejection of synthetic augmentation.”

---

### **Kor’el Mal’keth** *(scoffs)*:  
“And yet they *fight*. The Damocles Crusade taught us that humans are always dangerous — even these ones. And now these *gardeners* disable Imperial warships, destroy convoys, infiltrate worlds with illusions and... ninjas.”  
*(He shakes his head.)*  
“Even *I* wouldn’t believe it if it weren’t in Imperial transmissions.”

---

### **Aun’Vre Sali**:  
“The Concord reminds me of the Mont’au myths — the era before the Greater Good — where survival was dictated by tribal cunning, not systemic unity.”

---

### **Fio’El Tor’vas** *(curiously)*:  
“Their bioships could be the result of biological nanofabrication. Perhaps remnants of a highly advanced bio-science... not regression, but *alternative progress*.”

---

### **Por’El Doran** *(musing)*:  
“And yet... they *chose* this path. Not because they had to, but because they saw something in *our* world — in the Imperium, in the Galactic Empire — that repelled them.”

---

### **Aun’Vre Sali** *(calmly)*:  
“Perhaps. Or perhaps they saw what *we* could become if we are not careful. The Concord seems immune to memetic decay, perhaps due to this integration of psychic intuition and cultural cohesion.”

---

### **Kor’el Mal’keth**:  
“If they were closer to the Eastern Fringe, I’d recommend neutral observation. But here — surrounded by wolves and fire — I fear they will be trampled unless they continue to disappear like ghosts.”

---

### **Aun’Vre Sali** *(thoughtfully)*:  
“They are a seed among firestorms. And still they grow.”

> **[Conference concludes. A directive is issued for a low-profile Water Caste contact attempt via Federation intermediaries. Strategic profile: **Observe**, **Preserve**, **Do not provoke**.]**  
> **Tag: "Concord Analysis: Non-aligned Non-Expansionist Biocultural Civilization. Classified Level E (Ethical/Cultural Memetic Impact Study)"]**

---

**Title: Operation Whisperleaf**  
**Location: Uncharted Concord-aligned Biosphere World, Outer Halo of the Galactic Core**  
**Actors: Tau Water Caste Delegation | Federation Liaison Officers | Concord Elven Envoys**  
**Objective: Establish non-hostile cultural contact and low-impact diplomatic thread between the Tau Empire and the Concord, using the neutral presence of the Federation as trusted intermediaries.**

---

### **Scene: Aboard a Concord Living Ship — “Vaelthari” (translated: ‘Dew of the Stars’)**  
The ship does not dock. It *grows* a platform. From the sleek, geometric lines of the **Tau diplomatic shuttle**, a **Water Caste trio** emerges in ceremonial robes of soft ocean blue and white. In contrast to Tau efficiency, the bioship is all curves, breathing walls, gentle bioluminescence — a space that feels like both cathedral and forest grove.

Waiting for them are **two Federation liaison officers**, already present on Concord worlds to study their culture. Beside them stands **an Elven Envoy** — tall, luminous, and quiet, dressed in woven leaves and moonlight silver.

---

### **Cast:**
- **Por’El Doran** – Tau Water Caste Lead Envoy  
- **Lt. Commander Mira Chen** – Federation Science Officer  
- **Commander Thalos Vaenil** – Elven Envoy of the Concord  
- **Por’Ui Selem** – Junior Tau Diplomat, nervous but eager  
- **Lt. Tuvik** – Federation Vulcan Liaison Officer

---

### **Dialogue Excerpt:**

**Por’El Doran** *(bowing gently)*:  
“We come in peace, guided by curiosity and humility. We thank the Federation for arranging this... unusual meeting.”

**Thalos Vaenil** *(softly, with melodic tones)*:  
“You step lightly for one from the Forge-Worlds. The Earth trembles not beneath you. This is noted.”

**Lt. Mira Chen** *(to both parties)*:  
“The Federation believes this mutual contact has merit. You both express restraint amid chaos. That alone is rare in the Galactic Core.”

**Por’Ui Selem** *(nervously interjecting)*:  
“We have reviewed limited transmissions from your kind. You live among... trees?”

**Thalos Vaenil** *(smiling slightly)*:  
“We live *with* them. And they live with us. What you call infrastructure, we call kin.”

**Lt. Tuvik** *(Vulcan tone, to the Tau)*:  
“It is biologically viable. Their ecosystem has been shaped over millennia with psionic coevolution. Think... an organic computer, cultivated rather than manufactured.”

**Por’El Doran** *(diplomatic curiosity)*:  
“This diverges radically from the caste-specialization model of the Tau. Do your people not fear inefficiency? Chaos?”

**Thalos Vaenil** *(tilting head)*:  
“Does your water fear the sky? All flows. But in its time.”

---

### **Purpose of Contact:**

The Water Caste seeks to:

- **Understand Concord’s stance on technology**, particularly its fusion of psychic, ecological, and biological systems.
- **Assess potential for cultural exchange**, especially with regard to psi-harmony navigation and stealth technology, which remain mysterious to Tau science.
- **Map a future possibility of neutrality or informal alliance**, should wider galactic conflicts escalate.

The Concord, through Thalos, agrees to limited cultural sharing **only through the Federation** — a trusted “soft path.” They do not welcome colonization, and make this clear. Their philosophy is not up for bargaining. Their interest lies only in **balance**.

---

### **Outcome:**

- **Encrypted Federation packet** confirms **stable low-bandwidth communication channel** between Concord and Water Caste.
- **Tau High Command** informed of a **“non-hostile, non-material threat”** – a culture whose defense lies not in weapons but in unreadable intuition.
- **Concord grants a single seed**, a **“memory-pod”** – containing psionic botanical data that *can only be read in dreams*.

As the bioship breathes and the Tau return to their shuttle, **Por’Ui Selem turns to Por’El Doran** and whispers:

> “We traded equations and metal. They gave us silence and stillness. I think... we got the better deal.”

Por’El Doran, for once, has no immediate rebuttal.
