# The Stargate Crusade - Part 2

## **📜 Scene: “You Are No God” — The Jaffa Returns**

**Location:** *Cell 07-A, Fort Sanctus Veritus, Abydos Prime*  
**Characters**:  
- *Khensu*, Goa’uld former System Lord, prisoner  
- *Sergeant Kalar Vesh*, former First Prime of Khensu, now a Guardsman of the Imperium

---

The cell is dim, lit only by a lumen coil overhead. On the walls, pict-projection runes cycle endlessly: images of the Emperor’s golden throne, the spires of Holy Terra, and Kriegers marching beneath banners that read *"MANKIND ENDURES."*

Khensu sits hunched on the cell’s edge. His ornate golden armor has been stripped away, replaced by plain grey robes. His symbiote stirs restlessly inside him. The daily propaganda broadcasts have broken him—they have eroded his pride and belief in false divinity.

He looks up as the cell door hisses open.

Footsteps. Heavy. Measured. Familiar.

Into the light steps a broad-shouldered warrior in a crimson-trimmed flak coat. Across his chest: the double-headed aquila. His bald head is marked with a newly inked aquila tattoo on the left temple. At his side is a lasgun. His face is grim.

Khensu narrows his eyes. “You.”

The soldier inclines his head, eyes piercing.

> **Kalar Vesh**: “Yes, my Lord. Or… you were.”

A pause.

> **Khensu** (half-snarl): “You were *my* First Prime. You carried my banner into battle. You bled for me.”

> **Kalar**: “No. I bled for a lie. For a parasite with a loud voice and a stolen crown.”

Khensu surges forward, veins rising with fury. “I *gave* you strength! I *made* you more than a slave!”

> **Kalar**: “No. You gave me chains and called them blessings.”

He steps forward into the cell. The guards do not interfere.

> **Kalar**: “You lied to us. Told us the stars were yours. Told us your voice came from the gods. But then I saw *them*—the Imperials. The Kriegers who do not fear death. The Saint-preachers who speak not for themselves, but for a God they have *never* seen… and still believe.”

He pauses, voice cold as steel:

> **Kalar**: “You claim to be a god. But you wept when your ship burned.”

Khensu breathes heavily. “You… traitor.”

> **Kalar**: “No. I was never truly yours. I was merely asleep.”

He steps closer, eyes hard.

> **Kalar**: “Now I am *awake*. And I see what you never wanted us to see.”

He taps his chest where the aquila lies.

> **Kalar**: “We are *Mankind*. The Imperium does not *enslave* us. It *reminds* us of who we are. It gives us meaning. A home. A *truth* worth dying for.”

Khensu’s voice falters. “…You’re being brainwashed.”

> **Kalar** (quietly): “Maybe. But if so, I choose the fire that purifies over the shadow that poisons.”

The silence is deafening.

> **Kalar**: “The Emperor is not like you. He does not speak. He does not command. He *inspires*. And men build *cathedrals* just to honor his silence.”

Khensu slumps slightly, as if struck.

> **Kalar**: “I came to say farewell. We march soon. More of your 'gods' await judgment. I will fight them, as I should have fought you.”

He turns to leave.

> **Khensu** (softly): “You’re just another slave… following another voice.”

Kalar pauses at the doorway.

> **Kalar** (without turning): “No. I am a *soldier*. And my God does not fear the truth.”

The door slides shut behind him.

Khensu is left alone in silence—except for the ever-looping chant echoing from the vox:

> *“There is only the Emperor, and He is our Shield and Protector.”*

Khensu stares at the wall… and for the first time in centuries, feels *uncertain*.

## **🔥 Scene: Rebellion Ignites Among the Stars**

**Location:** *Multiple Goa’uld Worlds*  
**Event:** *Unauthorized slave revolts across several Goa’uld holdings*

In the shadowed adobe hovels and sweat-soaked fields of a Goa’uld-held world, whispers travel fast on cracked lips and broken dreams. Word of the Imperium’s crushing victories over the Goa’uld fleets and their slave armies spreads like wildfire through hidden channels. The promise of liberation ignites a fire deep in the hearts of the enslaved.

In the depths of **P3-Xael**, a mining colony, slaves watch in secret a **pirated Imperial propaganda broadcast**:

> *“The Emperor protects. The false gods tremble. The sons of Terra come not to conquer, but to redeem. Rise, children of humanity. The true light has returned.”*

**Revolts begin.**

Staff weapons are seized. Overseers are strangled in their sleep. Goa’uld statues are toppled, burned.

On **P4-Hekat**, a priest of Ra is drowned in molten naquadah. The slaves chant a phrase **they do not fully understand**, but feel with every fiber of their being:

> “*For the Emperor!*”

Across **dozens of gate-connected worlds**, a **slow-burn insurrection** begins, feeding upon itself.

And so—before even the next Astartes drop pod has touched soil—the Goa’uld feel the cracks in their empire.

Not just from above.

But from **within**.

**Slave Leader Tarek** rallies a band of desperate men and women under the waning moon:

> “Brothers and sisters! The tyrants who have shackled us with false gods are losing their grip! The Emperor’s light shines beyond the stars—rise, strike now, and seize your freedom!”

Armed with crude tools and stolen blades, the slaves storm their overseers’ compounds in ragged fury. Fires blaze, screams pierce the night, and the first sparks of rebellion flicker into flame.

---
#### Goa’uld Retribution

But the Goa’uld do not suffer such insolence lightly. From towering command ziggurats and bastions, alarms blare as elite Jaffa legions pour into the streets, their silver blades glinting coldly beneath harsh floodlights.

**Jaffa Commander Syed** snarls orders:

> “Crush the uprising with merciless force! Let none survive to spread these lies of freedom!”

Amidst blazing disruptor fire and brutal close-quarters slaughter, the rebellion is extinguished mercilessly. Fields run red, and the once hopeful slaves fall silent once more beneath the yoke of their false gods.

---

#### The Arrival of the Black Templars

Days later, a thunderous roar fills the sky as the **Black Templars’ crusader drop pods** emerges like a shooting star of flaming death, landing in righteous fury.

**Captain Elias Thorne** addresses his battle-brothers, voice booming with zeal:

> “Brothers! The Emperor’s wrath descends! No heretic, xeno, or slave master shall remain unjudged! We bring His light to shatter their darkness!”

Black Templars warriors, clad in jet black power armor emblazoned with the imperial cross, surge forth with bolters blazing, chainswords roaring. They tear through Goa’uld temples and Jaffa battalions alike, the righteous fury of the Emperor cleansing every corner.

Slave pens are smashed open, chains broken, and the shackled rise trembling yet victorious, tears mingling with sweat as they kneel before the crusaders.

**Captain Thorne**, standing amidst the ruins, proclaims:

> “This world is reclaimed for the God-Emperor! Let all who dare defy His will know—freedom lies with the Imperium, and none shall escape His judgment!”

The desert sun shines down on a world reborn, its shadows forever cast aside by the crusaders’ fiery passage.

### The Emperor’s Wrath — A Black Templar’s Tale
**By Brother-Captain Elias Thorne of the Black Templars**

The air tastes thick with ash and blood. The wails of the enslaved haunt the scorched dust beneath my boots. This world, once a festering blight under the false gods, is about to know the true light of the Emperor.

I am Brother-Captain Elias Thorne of the Black Templars, and I bring His fury to bear.

Days before our arrival, whispers reached us — desperate murmurs of slaves daring to dream of freedom, ignited by tales of the Imperium’s victories through the stargate. They rose like a flame, striking at their tormentors with raw fury and broken weapons.

But the Goa’uld answered in kind. Jaffa legions descended like wolves upon lambs, tearing through hope with cruel blades and unholy fire. The slaves’ rebellion was crushed beneath their heels. Their screams echoed in the night, and the false gods’ yoke tightened.

I stood aboard my battle barge, the *Sword of Redemption*, addressing my brothers-at-arms.

> “Brothers! The Emperor calls us! His justice demands no quarter for heretic or xeno!” I shouted, my voice carrying the fire of righteous wrath.

My battle-brothers, clad in jet black armor emblazoned with the imperial cross, bolters and chainswords in hand, boarded the drop pods, preparing to bring the Emperor's Divine Light upon this wretched tortured world of long-lost humanity.

And as we descended down in these shooting stars of righteous fury, we chanted the Litany of Deliverance, our minds entirely focused on the mission at hand.

We descended upon the slave pens and temples of these parasites with holy fury. Every step a hammer blow to the false gods’ empire.

The Jaffa fought fiercely, but our training, zeal, and faith proved stronger. Bolter shells tore through their ranks, and the Emperor’s will surged through my veins as I cleaved through the enemy with my chainsword.

As chains shattered and shackles fell, I witnessed tears streaming down faces etched with years of pain. The freed raised their eyes to us—pale faces broken but unbowed. Kneeling, they swore fealty not to false gods, but to the God-Emperor of Mankind.

> “This world belongs to the Emperor,” I declared, voice ringing over the ruins. “And His light shall shine eternal!”

The desert sun bore down on us, washing away the shadows of slavery and false gods. Today, we reclaim not just a world, but the honor of humanity itself.

The battle is won, but the war is far from over.

As I stand atop the shattered steps of the pyramid temple, the desert wind carries the whispers of a world reborn—and the weight of a world that must be rebuilt.

The slaves we freed are no longer mere victims but the foundation of a new Imperium world. They look to us with hope, but also fear—fear of what freedom truly means, and of the darkness still lurking beyond the stargate.

Our task now is to forge this shattered land into a loyal province of the Emperor’s domain.

The Mechanicus arrive swiftly, their servitors already dismantling the corrupted xeno tech and reclaiming relics of the Dark Age of Technology for our own use. The Ecclesiarchy sends priests to purify the souls of the freed, spreading the true faith to replace the lies of the Goa’uld.

Yet, I cannot ignore the scars—the memories of cruelty burned into every face, the ruins still heavy with the stench of oppression.

Many ask if the Emperor’s justice is mercy. I tell them: justice is truth, and truth is the foundation of peace.

In my heart, I know the fight will continue. Other worlds await liberation, and the shadows of the Goa’uld stretch far.

But here on this world, under the eternal light of the Emperor, I swear that no false god shall rise again.

For now, I prepare my men—not just for battle, but for the slow, sacred work of rebuilding humanity’s honor.

A new chapter dawns, and I will wield the Emperor’s sword until His will is done.

I am a Black Templar. I bring the Emperor’s justice—and His salvation—to the darkest corners of the galaxy.

For the Emperor! For humanity!

## 🐍 **Reaction in Goa’uld Space**

### 🛸 **System Lord Council – A Storm of Fury**

**The System Lords convene in a great chamber beneath a pyramid-mothership somewhere in Goa’uld space. Golden thrones. Firelight. Rage.**

> **Ba'al:**  
> “What is the Imperium?! Who gave them this power? Where were they hiding?!”

> **Yu:**  
> “They are not Jaffa. They are something else. Their weapons did not even flicker when our staff blasts struck.”

> **Nerakh-Toth (who ruled P3-Karn):**  
> *[Screaming]*  
> “They **burned my temples**. They **slaughtered my priest-kings**. They hung my name from my own obelisk!”

> **Aphophis (brooding):**  
> “And they call *us* parasites…?”

Many system lords **accuse each other** of creating the Imperium as some sort of secret army. Some whisper the word **“Tau’ri”**, remembered from ancient rebel prophecies, though none can agree on the origin.

> **Ra:**  
> “This Imperium… they don’t even believe in gods. They only believe in themselves. That’s what makes them dangerous.”

The System Lords realize—**for the first time in centuries**—that they are being hunted not by scattered rebels…  
…but by an **entire empire** of technologically, ideologically, and militarily overwhelming **humans**.

And worst of all?

They can come through the **gates**.

---

## 📜 **The Goa’uld Counterattack at Forward Bastion Karnos**

**Location:** *Forward Bastion Karnos* – a fortified Imperial outpost constructed on a newly claimed gate world near the outer edge of Goa’uld influence, garrisoned by **Krieg Guardsmen** and elements of the **Adeptus Astartes – Iron Hands Chapter**.

The Imperial outpost is fortified against exterior intrusion: thick walls and void shields to protect against orbital bombardment. But also the outpost is fortified against a possible *interior* intrusion, lest a hostile force comes through the *stargate itself*.

### 🚪 **Event: The Stargate Activates**

The air hums with latent energy. The chevrons lock. The ancient ring whines into life. Red runes glow across its circumference.

> **Sergeant Vark (Krieg 83rd Siege Regiment):**  
> “Activation. Code Alpha-Zeta. Not one of ours. Positions!”

Immediately, the guardsmen dive into **trenches and ferrocrete pillboxes**, lasguns primed. The vox-crackle of binharic alerts reaches the battle servitors, who lurch to readiness. **Astartes in ceramite plate** ready their bolters behind the fort's central blast doors.

Then—**a surge of light**, and **Jaffa troops flood through the Stargate**.

They pour out, hundreds strong, shouting in foreign tongues, gold and black armor shining, **staff weapons crackling** with plasma fire.

### 💥 **The Battle Begins**

But they don’t land in confusion. They land **in a kill box**.

> **Lieutenant Vhoran (Iron Heralds):**  
> “Target acquired. Initiate culling.”

The first ranks of Jaffa are **cut down instantly** by withering volleys of **lasfire and autocannon shots**. Those who survive are pinned under **precision bolter fire** from Astartes stationed at elevated sanctums. The **Krieg flamers** deploy, burning through the unwanted guests.

> **Jaffa Commander, screaming:**  
> “What are these monsters?! They are not men—they are death!”

The Jaffa retreat into the open, but they find no cover. Krieger mortars fall with **merciless precision**, guided by centuries of trench warfare doctrine. **Astartes chainswords roar** as a final push mops up the survivors.

> **No Imperials fall.**
> **Not a single one.**

A battered staff weapon clatters across the stone floor as the last Jaffa dies.

The Stargate closes.

## 📡 **Transmission to Segmentum Command – Commissar Vrangell**

> “Retaliatory strike attempted by xeno-parasite forces through Karnos Gate.  
> Entire hostile force annihilated. No losses sustained.  
> Recommend escalation.”

---

## 🐍 **Scene: System Lord Council in disarray**

The Goa’uld System Lords convene again—**fewer this time**, and more shaken. Each sits on a black-throned dais, flanked by slave attendants and ribboned Jaffa.

A transmission is replayed—captured by a long-range listening post.

**[Recording: Imperial troops slaughtering Jaffa under thunderous chants of "For the Emperor!"]**

> **Ba'al (narrowing eyes):**  
> “Those were not Tau’ri. Those were not even rebels. They… they fought like machines.”

> **Ra (furious):**  
> “They knew we were coming. They laid a trap!”

> **Apophis (tentatively):**  
> “They said 'Imperium of Man'. That is not a name I have heard… not among the Tau’ri, nor the Tok'ra, nor the Free Jaffa.”

> **Yu (coldly):**  
> “They may be… *something else*. An unknown polity. Hidden. Ancient. Arrogant.”

> **Ra (with a hint of fear):**  
> “What civilization trains its soldiers to die without emotion and builds living fortresses around these rings?”

They fall into silence.

And then, quietly…

> **Batset:**  
> “Perhaps they were seeded by the Ancients. An old, secret experiment. They act as though they have ruled half the galaxy…”

> **Apophis (growing rage):**  
> “They defy our divinity. They destroy our temples. They desecrate our icons. We *must* retaliate.”

> **Ra:**  
> “No. We must learn more. We know not where they come from. What if… they have more?”

## 🧠 **Unknown to the Goa’uld...**

The Imperium **does not come from Tau’ri**.

They come from **Terra**, a near-perfect copy of Earth—**one of many planted long ago by a Type III civilization**, now a **star-choked bastion in the Galactic Core**, surrounded by hive cities, void fortresses, and a million armies.

The Goa’uld are parasites on humanity’s edge.

The Imperium is its **core**.

And now they know the way through the gates.

### ⚔️ Scene 1: *The Gates of P3-Karnak*

The Goa’uld world of **P3-Karnak** was no feudal backwater.

It was a throne-world of the minor System Lord **Neferru**, known for his obsession with technological “divinity.” Unlike Abydos or P3-Karn, Karnak was a fortress—ringed with turreted walls of naquadah-enforced stone, automated plasma spears lining its ramparts, and fleets of gliders on constant patrol.

But Karnak fell in *three days*.

- On Day 1, the Stargate erupted with coordinated multi-regiment deployment: Cadian Shock Troops, Krieger Sappers, and Scions from the Ventrillian Nobles.
- On Day 2, Drop Pods from the **Angels Penitent** Chapter of the Adeptus Astartes screamed through the upper atmosphere, striking like thunderbolts of judgment.
- On Day 3, the great Temple of Neferru was brought low by meltagun teams and Leman Russ demolishers, its golden idol shattered, its priest-guards executed.

The final moment of the battle: Neferru’s private ha’tak vessel tried to escape—but was blown from orbit by a Nova Cannon fired from the newly arrived *Vigilant Sky*.

> *"The Emperor does not recognize false divinity. We are not liberators. We are restorers of rightful order."*  
> —**Canoness Dreya Vhal**, Order of the Azure Flame, before ordering the execution of the Goa'uld priest caste.

---

### 🪖 Scene 2: *Resistance on P4-Ra'tak*

**P4-Ra'tak** was different. Here, the Jaffa did not break and scatter—they *fought*.

Armed with energy weapons modified from Ancient tech, wearing reinforced battle-plate, and fighting under the banner of System Lord **Mekhet**, the Jaffa showed uncharacteristic tactical discipline. For once, they used cover, deployed in squads, and fought to the death.

But the Imperials had faced worse.

- Krieger tunneling teams emerged beneath their fortresses, collapsing bunkers with seismic charges.
- Astartes of the **Iron Sentinels** Chapter breached the command dome, killing Lord Mekhet in personal combat.
- Valkyrie air patrols eliminated glider wings before they even launched.

The Mechanicus confiscated Mekhet’s personal data-vaults—over 20 terabytes of Goa’uld-processed “Ancient” blueprints, now reclaimed for the Omnissiah.

---

### 🔊 Scene 3: *The Broadcast Heard Across a Thousand Worlds*

Following these victories, the Imperium transmitted yet another broad-spectrum pict-cast across all known stargate-connected networks:

> *"The Emperor has spoken through flame and steel. The parasitic Lords who call themselves gods are but worms upon the corpse of a forgotten age. The Imperium of Man reclaims what was always His. Submit and be redeemed. Resist and be obliterated."*  
> —**Segmentum Command Vox Decree 227-Solar-GLORIANNA**

Slave populations on five worlds rose up within days of the transmission. Goa’uld loyalist cities burned from within before a single lasgun was fired. Local populations offered coordinates of hidden System Lord caches in exchange for Ecclesiarchal “purification rites” and citizenship under the Imperium.

---

### 🛠️ Scene 4: Mechanicus Reaction

On **P3-Nekkhet**, Mechanicus Tech-Priests unearthed what they claimed was a Goa’uld-transfigured version of a DAoT “matter-phase redistributor.”

After consecrated dismantling and six days of data-exorcism, it was confirmed:

> *"Holy design patterns embedded within profane casing. Corrupted knowledge, now cleansed by cogitative rite. The Goa’uld are nothing but scavengers gnawing on the corpse of the Omnissiah’s bounty."*  
> —**Magos Varn Hallex**, Explorator-Archmagos

## **The Imperium campaign against Cronus**

**Location:** the planet of Goa'uld System Lord **Cronus**, named **Nekh-Ma’at**.

**Scene:** On a Goa'uld world, inside of a huge city made of sandstone, granite, and polished marble. In the middle of the city, a ceremonial open-air plaza flanked by silent stone faces. In the middle of the plaza, a Stargate portal to other worlds.

The Stargate howled to life like a cyclone of ancient fire, its chevrons locking in one by one with a rhythmic, alien groan. A blast of luminous field erupted from its ring before collapsing inward to form the rippling event horizon — blue, ancient, hungry.

A moment passed — stillness.

Then, the first figure emerged from the gate.

Clad in a long black coat with crimson trim, gold epaulettes on his shoulder, and a red sash knotted at his waist, **Distinguished Commissar Mark Vrangell** stepped into the plaza like a revenant of forgotten wars. His bolt pistol was raised, but still. In his other hand, he bore the standard of the Imperium: the double-headed Aquila sewn in gold thread upon a crimson banner, held high and resolute.

Behind him, rank after rank of Imperial Guardsmen surged through the shimmering veil, their boots thudding onto the polished granite stone. Lasguns were drawn and eyes hardened beneath the visors of their flak helmets. The air was tense with prophecy.

They had come to kill a god.

The ceremonial Jaffa guards, stationed around the plaza like statues, at first were paralyzed with confusion. They were the finest parade Jaffa of Cronus. They knew how to march, how to salute, and how to keep their armor shiny. But had never before fought in a battle against a foreign military. They had fought against rebellious peasants, against the nomadic tribes of raiders who lived in the mountains, but not against **actual trained solders**, of the *Imperium of Man* no less.

One stepped forward, young, decorated, bearing the sigil of Cronus on his brow.

“You dare set foot upon the soil of Lord Cronus unbidden?” he spat. “You trespass on holy ground.”

The Jaffa raised his staff weapon. He never finished aiming.

A bolt round tore through his torso like a fist through silk. The sound cracked the air. His body spun and crashed to the stone, smoldering.

Around the plaza, shouts rose in panic and fury. The Jaffa scrambled for cover, barking orders.

But the Imperial Guardsmen were already fanning out, securing firing angles. Sentinel walkers emerged from the gate next, followed by wheeled command platforms and vox pylons.

The ceremonial Jaffa guards were all either killed or taken prisoner in less than a minute.

Vrangell’s boots clinked upon the stone as he ascended the raised platform at the center of the plaza. Goa’uld statues loomed around them — crocodile-headed gods, jackal-faced giants, etched with hieroglyphs and leering eyes.

Without speaking, he planted the Imperial banner into the ancient tiles.

The wind caught it.

It unfurled with imperial majesty — the Aquila glaring down upon the city of false gods.

Vrangell finally turned. His voice boomed like thunder across the plaza.

> “This world belongs to no god. Not Cronus, nor Ra, nor any parasite in a golden mask. It belongs to the Imperium of Man — and today, your heresy ends.”

From the Stargate’s inner shimmer emerged a second wave — not soldiers, but **saints**.

Clad in white and red power armor, their eyes veiled behind helms etched with sacred writ, came the **Sisters of Battle**. Their purity seals flapped like relics of flame in the wind. Each bore a bolter in reverent readiness. They marched not as warriors alone, but as a **choir of vengeance.**

The **Sister Superior Lucia** raised a hand, and they began to chant.

> _“Lo, though I walk in the valley of the shadow of heresy…”_  
> _“…I shall fear no false god.”_

The hymn pierced the smog-laden air. It rang across the plaza like a cleansing blade, a song of fire and steel.

Incense burned at their waists. Vox-priests intoned liturgies. Auspexes scanned for psychic corruption.

For the first time in ten thousand years, the sacred plaza of Nekh-Ma’at echoed not with the measured boots of Jaffa patrols, but with the roar of Leman Russ engines and the disciplined clatter of armored treads. The plaza itself, ancient and cracked with the weight of millennia, seemed to recoil as the Imperium's tanks drove through the Stargate.

---

In the command briefing aboard the orbital lander, data streamed in.

Cronus’s world, named **Nekh-Ma’at**, was once a fortress-temple. Beneath its cities lay labyrinthine vaults of psychic resonance — relics of forgotten wars, perhaps even pre-Goa’uld civilizations. Cronus had built his palace atop these faultlines, siphoning power for millennia.

> “This is not merely conquest,” Vrangell muttered, reading the hololith. “This is an exorcism.”

His vox clicked open.  
> “All units: prepare for full planetary assault. The false god shall not escape. Let his heresy burn in the fire of righteous steel.”

Above them, storm clouds churned in silent thunder. The statues of Cronus watched as the army of the Emperor spread through his streets.

The gate had opened.

And through it came the retribution of man.

---

## **The God Declares**

From the black stone palace at the city’s heart — a monstrous ziggurat crowned in obsidian and gold — the skies trembled as **Cronus** spoke.

His voice, thunderous and proud, echoed from unseen vox-torches embedded in every column, every statue, every pyramid-shouldered monument. From city to hinterlands, the inhabitants of Nekh-Ma’at stopped and stared at the heavens.

> “I am CRONUS,” came the voice, deep as tectonic plates grinding. “Son of Ra. Slayer of Titans. Wielder of the Nine-Fold Staff. I have ruled this world for a thousand years. You, who crawl from your iron gate and hide behind your crude armor — you are not conquerors. You are insects, biting the skin of a god.”

Above the citadel, lightning split the clouds, and psychic energy pulsed in waves from the tower’s peak. At its apex, Cronus stood, flanked by Jaffa in crimson armor, his symbiote-lined eyes glowing with raw malice.

> “Your weapons are toys. Your Emperor is dust. And you, you little men with your banners and chants… you will die screaming before my feet.”

---

In the plaza, **Commissar Mark Vrangell** stood unmoving, his face unshaken. His vox-officers adjusted the broadcast channel. They had captured the signal. Now it was time to reply.

The Commissar turned toward the half-assembled ranks of Sisters, Guardsmen, and priests. Behind him, the Imperial banner flapped like the heartbeat of civilization itself.

He gestured to **Sister Lucia of the Order of the Exorcist**, a veteran canoness clad in scarlet power armor etched with golden purity seals. Her helmet was off, revealing a stern, serene face. Her eyes glowed faintly — touched by the Emperor’s light.

She took the vox-mic with unhurried reverence.

Her voice rang out, amplified across the entire city through Imperial comms, tuned to override the Goa’uld broadcast infrastructure:

> “You are not a god. You are a heretic.”

Her voice was iron and fire.

> “You wear false glory like a child draped in his father’s robes. You enslave through fear and rule through deception. You are a parasite wearing stolen flesh.”

The soldiers in the plaza saluted — Guardsmen tightened their grips on lasguns. Even the civilians listening from balconies and rooftops began to shift uneasily, sensing the upcoming battle.

Sister Lucia raised her voice.

> “By the authority of the Holy Orders of the Emperor’s Inquisition, and the Canon Militant of the Adepta Sororitas, I declare Cronus guilty of Exterminatus-level heresy.”

> “Let his palace burn. Let his idols fall. Let no stone of his sanctuary remain unpurged.”


A servo-skull floated to her shoulder, projecting a glowing sigil into the air above the plaza — the **Inquisitorial “I”**, wreathed in flame.

The crowd fell silent.

Then came the second confirmation — from **Father Feofan**, a ranking hieromancer of the Ecclesiarchy. Holding his staff of office carved with skulls and suns, he chanted in High Gothic, invoking the **Rite of Soul-Penetration**.

> “The palace is corrupted,” he whispered, after closing his eyes. “The air around it is not air. It is _saturated essence._ Malignant. Twisted. It clings to the bones of the city like mold to rotting bread.”

> “He does not rule it. He _feeds_ from it.”

The implication spread like oilfire.

Cronus was not merely a despot. He had become **a blasphemous node**, channeling the psychic rot of a dying pantheon.

---

Beneath the giant sandstone towers, their faces carved in false divinity — crocodile, hawk, jackal, serpent — **Commissar Vrangell walked the ranks** of his troops. The polished stone clinked under his boots.

He turned to the soldiers gathered there, voices raised in final preparation.

> “Soldiers of the Imperium,” he began. “You know what you are. And you know what he is.”

> “There is no glory here — only duty. There is no god here — only a heretic with stolen fire.”

> “Today we break his palace. Tomorrow we break his soul.”

He raised his bolt pistol.

> “The Emperor watches.”

From the tanks came roars of ignition. From the Sisters came hymns of vengeance. And from the Guardsmen — silence. That heavy, anticipatory silence of those about to do the sacred work of war.

Above them, Cronus watched — a jackal with a scepter, mistaking thunder for power.

But the storm had already arrived.

---

## **The March Through Nekh-Ma’at**

The ground trembled with the song of engines.

The **Leman Russ tanks** rolled first — their adamantine treads crushing ancient stone underfoot, grinding millennia of Goa’uld arrogance into dust. The twin barrels of Executioner and Vanquisher patterns pointed forward like accusing fingers. Behind them came the massed ranks of the **Imperial Guard**, lasguns at the ready, their faces grim beneath their helmets.

**Commissar Mark Vrangell** walked at the head of the column, a sword sheathed at his side, his bolt pistol drawn. Beside him strode **Sister Lucia**, her black armor radiant in the dusky light, a censer of sacred incense swinging from her wrist. Her expression was calm. Radiant. Unafraid.

They advanced through the avenues of **Nekh-Ma’at**, the capital of Cronus’s empire — a city of towers chiseled from sandstone, granite, and marble, draped in banners bearing the serpent and sun-disc. Towering statues of Cronus lined the boulevard, arms crossed in self-worship, eyes filled with glowing malice. The city had the eerie silence of a trap laid well.

And then it was sprung.

---

From atop temple spires and carved obelisks, **plasma fire erupted**.

Blinding beams of blue-white energy speared from golden **plasma obelisks**, ancient Goa’uld defense pylons reawakened after centuries. On the rooftops, **Jaffa warriors** raised staff cannons and let loose blasts that tore through the front line, melting ceramite, incinerating men.

A Leman Russ exploded, its turret blown clean off by a direct hit. Screams filled the air. Then the second barrage came — heavy staff weapons mounted to ziggurat towers, **blazing down on the Imperials** like the wrath of false gods.

**Urban warfare engulfed the streets.**

Guardsmen darted between broken columns, firing lasguns upward into the angles of unseen death. Jaffa struck from balconies, vanished through trapdoors, reappeared behind walls. Each street corner became a blood-soaked crucible.

The **city fought like a living machine**, and it knew its terrain.

A sergeant was vaporized. A squad was cut down in an alley. Another vanished beneath the collapse of a booby-trapped aqueduct.

> “Forward!” Vrangell shouted, rallying the line. “No retreat!”

And then came the fire from heaven.

**The Exorcist tanks arrived.**

With a deafening hymn played from their hull-mounted voxcasters, **the Sisters of Battle’s Exorcists** entered the fray — purple tanks enshrined in gothic reliquaries, with a rocket launchers as absolution for the heretics.

> “Sanctified payloads, release!” cried Sister-Seraphim Valette from within her command tank.

Dozens of **sacred missiles screamed into the skyline**, trailing incense and light, striking the plasma obelisks and rooftop artillery nests. The resulting detonations shook the city to its foundations. Entire buildings collapsed in divine fury, burying heretics and Jaffa in craters of purifying flame.

Through smoke and rubble, **Vrangell and Lucia led the charge** on foot.

They advanced through shattered temples, cutting down defenders in hallways lined with hieroglyphs declaring Cronus’s eternal reign. A Goa’uld priest-guard lunged from a shadow with a plasma glaive — **Lucia parried with her power sword**, then Vrangell shot the attacker through the eye.

Later, as a Jaffa sniper fired from above, Vrangell was exposed — **Lucia stepped forward**, raising her gauntlet, the round ricocheting from her bracer as she fired her bolt pistol upward, turning the rooftop to gore.

> “You owe me one,” she said calmly.  
> “Marking it down,” Vrangell replied, reloading.

Their bond was unspoken, forged in fire, holy and brutal.

---

Hours passed. The losses mounted.

Entire squads were vaporized. Medics collapsed beside their patients. The Guard’s vox channels crackled with prayer and agony. And yet… they held.

Because the **Sisters sang**.

Amid the warcries and screams, the **chants of the Adepta Sororitas** rose like incense: the **Canticle of the Falling Tyrant**, the **Litany of the Emperor’s Flame**, the **Dirge of the False God’s Undoing**.

Wounded soldiers crawled forward, lifted by those voices.

> “In the Emperor’s name, we do not falter.”

As the sun dipped behind the horizon and bathed the black palace in red, the Imperial army stood bloodied but unbroken, at the gates of Cronus’s final sanctuary.

The black stone **ziggurat of Cronus** loomed at the center of Nekh-Ma’at, its golden crown shimmering with eerie light, its stairs carved with hieroglyphs declaring eternal dominion. Smoke curled from its terraces; the air pulsed with latent menace. It was no mere structure — it was a throne, a fortress, and a weapon.

And it was about to fall.

---

### **The Arrival of Reinforcements**

The **Stargate flared to life** again — white-hot and roaring with dimensional thunder. From the blinding light emerged regiment after regiment of new troops. **The Death Korps of Krieg.**

Clad in greatcoats, gas masks hissing, their movements precise and silent, the Kriegers fanned out through the ruins of Nekh-Ma’at. They **dug in siege lines**, emplaced heavy mortars, and established kill-boxes with emotionless efficiency. They did not speak. They only advanced.

From vox-command, **Commissar Vrangell** gave the order.

> “The ziggurat must fall. Emperor wills it.”

The bombardment began.

---

### **The Resonance Field**

As the outer sanctum crumbled under **mortar and lascannon fire**, **Cronus retaliated**. From within the ziggurat, the Goa’uld overlord **activated a forgotten relic** — a resonance generator woven from naquadah, blood-runes, and enslaved psychic echoes. A **pulse** rolled outward like a thunderclap of thought.

The air went silent.

Then came the screaming.

The Imperials at once experienced a terrible wave of psychic pressure, their heads becoming heavy iron anvils, the ground under their feet spinning. Guardsmen fell to their knees. Kriegers froze. Battle-sisters gritted their teeth. And if there had been a psyker among them, it would have induced temporary epilepsy. The **Resonance Dome** had formed — an invisible field blanketing the palace, a psychotronic distortion field. Within it, **hallucinations surged**: dead loved ones walking, comrades turning into daemons, the Emperor’s face twisted in shadow.

Some wept. Others temporarily went mad and turned their guns on friends.

Then one voice rose.

Standing atop a crumbled statue of Cronus, **Sister Lucia** lifted her power blade to the skies. Her voxcaster boomed with sacred wrath.

> “THIS IS A LIE!”

> “I see you, Cronus! Serpent of the pit, you are unmasked!”

With one hand, she raised her relic cross. With the other, she **sang**.

The **Litany of Unbreaking** echoed over the dome: an ancient Imperial chant that sends chills down your spine, reinforces your inner will, and clears your mind of the psychic pressure. It is part advanced psychological anti-hypnosis spell, part defense against memetic warfare, part cognitive anchor. Her voice cut through the hallucinations like a sword through mist.

One by one, the Sisters joined her.

Then the Guardsmen.

Then the Kriegers — their weapons raised.

They were no longer under the influence.

---

### **The Ascent Begins**

**Infiltration teams** of Kriegers moved first, ascending ziggurat stairways and forgotten tunnels. They placed charges, cracked bulkheads, gunned down Jaffa guardians swiftly and accurately. They advanced in darkness, flamers and bayonets clearing sanctums of the damned.

**Mark Vrangell** and **Sister Lucia** climbed together, step by step.

Through broken gates. Through fire-lit halls. Through Cronus’s inner sanctum, lined with statues of himself seated on thrones of skulls. Each room became a kill-zone, each corridor an ambush. Jaffa with spiked red armor met them with defiance and obscene unintelligible screams and died in flames.

Lucia’s **bolt pistol roared**, shattering a deathmask.

Vrangell’s **chainsword sang**, cleaving through flesh and arrogance.

At one point, Vrangell faltered — hit by a staff blast, cast to the floor. A Jaffa raised a blade to strike.

Lucia stepped between them.

> “You will not touch him.”

Her sword blazed white, and the false god's servant fell.

They rested briefly in the ruined vestibule of Cronus’s throne room.

Blood slicked the walls. The air reeked of ozone and burning gold. Vrangell turned to Lucia.

> “You should’ve left me,” he said, voice hoarse.

> “The Emperor would not have,” she replied, placing her fist on her heart. “Nor would I.”

They looked at each other for a moment — not as commissar and sister, but as man and woman who had bled and burned together, who had saved each other more times than they could count.

There were no words for it. Only the stillness between gunfire. The recognition of souls aligned in righteous fury ... and something more, something deeper. Because for people whose only purpose in life was being living weapons for their regime, sometimes such gentle moments of respite were needed, in order to retain their sanity, however brief as it may be, lest their souls get corrupted too.

Then came the last door.

The **throne of Cronus** waited beyond.

---

## **The False God Falls**

At the summit of the black ziggurat, the air was thin with smoke and ozone. Lightning crackled unnaturally above as if the skies themselves recoiled from what lay beneath.

The great obsidian doors of the **inner sanctum** creaked open with a thunderous groan, and from within stepped the tyrant.

**Cronus descended** on a **hovering golden throne**, coiled in serpentine armor, his eyes burning with borrowed power from some *thing*. His voice echoed not just in sound but in mind — a telepathic command alongside his real voice, used for shock and awe.

> “Kneel,” he hissed, the voice of a thousand enthralled hosts layered atop his own. “I am a god eternal.”

Behind him, **psychic thralls** — once scholars, soldiers, and priests — floated like broken dolls, their mouths open in endless chanting. Their souls were shackled to his will.

The chamber shuddered. Darkness pressed in.

But the Sister did not kneel.

**Sister Lucia stepped forward**, armored in scorched ceramite, her blade cracked but unyielding. She spoke with the full force of the Ecclesiarchy:

> “Cronus of the Serpent Host, False God of Nekh-Ma’at, you stand condemned.”

She raised her relic sword, its edge humming with holy wrath.

> “In the name of the Emperor of Mankind, I pronounce the Final Rite of Denunciation. You are unclean. You are untrue. You are undone.”

Her words carried weight — not rhetoric, but liturgy. The psychic thralls screamed and convulsed. One combusted, his spirit liberated in fire.

Cronus shrieked, leaping from his throne with inhuman speed. A **plasma blade** burst from his gauntlet. He moved like a jumping spider, striking at Sister Lucia with impossible agility.

She met him blow for blow — a hurricane of precision and fury. Sparks flew as blade met blade, light against shadow.

Meanwhile, **Commissar Vrangell** advanced through the crossfire of Jaffa guards, his coat in tatters, vox-unit hissing orders even as his bolt pistol roared. He carved through the defenders like a knight of vengeance, leading the final push to the altar.

When he saw the opening — he didn’t hesitate.

**He raised his bolt pistol.**

> “Your reign ends, liar.”

And **emptied the full magazine** into Cronus’s serpentine cuirass. Each bolt round punched into his golden plating, detonating with bone-rending fury. The Goa’uld screamed — no longer like a god, but like a beast cornered.

Cronus staggered, ichor spilling from his side. He made one last lunge at Lucia — desperate, feral.

She sidestepped and disarmed him, her blade slashing through the emitter of his plasma gauntlet. His screams became gurgles.

He fell to his knees.

From his gaping throat, the **symbiote** writhed free — a silver serpent slick with blood, hissing toward the shadows.

Lucia looked down without pity.

> “This is your god?”

She raised her armored boot.

And **crushed the parasite into the stone**.

> “By His Will,” she declared, **“the heretic god dies.”**

---

### **Victory**

Outside, the storm broke.

The dome dissipated. The thralls collapsed. The city, once enthralled, was now free — in pain, but free.

Atop the highest tier of the ziggurat, **an Imperial banner** was raised — red, gold, double-headed. It flapped in the wind over a battlefield strewn with shell casings, broken statues, and dear soldiers, Imperial and Jaffa alike.

**Commissar Vrangell**, standing tall and bloodied, activated his vox-recorder.

> “This is Distinguished Commissar Marcus Vrangell, Imperium Crusade Command.”

> “Another heretic falls. Let the stars take heed.”

And on his shoulder he felt a hand. He turned and there was Sister Lucia. He didn't resist. Both warriors stood after the battle looking at each other, transcending their merely formal ordained from above comradery. As though even those accustomed to the horrors of war needed to heal and be healed. For they were neither servitors nor necrons, but living human souls with their own range of feelings, despite what the bureaucracy classified them as.

---

Khensu would have reacted with despair and existential dread if he knew what the Imperium was doing to the Goa'uld System Lords right now, *if* he was still conscious and able to understand that.

It was decided that the symbiote itself was too dangerous to be kept alive, lest it attempted to jump bodies and possess an Imperial official. So it was simply removed from the host and burned to ashes.

However this process of removing the parasite from the host was done by the Adeptus Mechanicus, not among the most informed when it comes to biology. While the parasite had indeed been successfully extracted, this operation was not done with any special consideration regarding the well being of the host. Following this operation the host also passed away, finally removing the man from his misery.

The Mechanicus were not concerned about the death of the host. He didn't need to be kept alive to be useful. For in the Imperium, **even in death do you serve!** Not an ounce of human resources was ever wasted, with grim efficiency.

The body of Khensu had been converted into a servitor. A brain-dead, lobotomized, augmented, cyborg slave. If Khensu were still able to understand such a thing, he would see the irony of having enslaved millions, only to himself end up as the worst form of slave, one without the ability to have an inner will, one whose servitude was indefinite. The irony of having been a puppeteer of a humanoid body, only to become puppeted by an algorithm. The irony of going from an immortal 'god' to a cybernetic undead. The irony of having fought against the Imperium to now loading up shells into it's big guns.

### **📺 Insert: Imperial Propaganda Broadcast – "The Thief and the Flame"**

> *A transmission intercepted by Goa'uld long-range comms from an Imperium vox-beacon somewhere in orbit around a captured gateworld.*

**[Transmission begins – Monotone Gothic Choir over brass fanfare]**

> **Vox Speaker:**  
> “The galaxy burns with false gods and the decay of stolen glories. Parasites coil themselves in the flesh of man, whispering divinity through stolen voices.”

*Cue images of Goa’uld pyramid ships over feudal slave worlds, spliced with clips of Jaffa guards oppressing human populations.*

> “These usurpers—these xeno abominations—dare wear the trappings of Man’s ancient triumphs. But their monuments are hollow. Their empires, rot-fattened carrion nests built atop the ruins of the Dark Age of Technology!”

*Cut to golden statuary of the Emperor, crowds kneeling before towering cathedrals on Terra.*

> “Behold Holy Terra, heartworld of the Imperium! Seat of the God-Emperor, undying guardian of Humanity. Ten thousand years He has watched, seated upon the Golden Throne. Not a false god of serpents and lies—but Mankind Ascendant, radiant and eternal.”

> “The Emperor’s Light spreads again across the stars. Let the xeno, the mutant, and the heretic know: your time is ended. Your thrones will be ashes. Your names, curses. The righteous shall inherit what was always theirs.”

**[Transmission ends – with a booming phrase:]**

> **“RECLAIM. REDEEM. BURN.”**

### **🛕 Scene: The System Lords’ Emergency Conclave**

*Location: Great Council Chamber, aboard Ra’s flagship — a palace-ship orbiting the Goa’uld fortress world of Delmak.*
**Attendees:** System Lords Ra, Bastet, Yu, Ba’al, and Apophis
#### ***Voices From the Core***  

A dimly-lit obsidian chamber lined with glowing control glyphs. Each System Lord seated upon a throne shaped like their personal iconography—jackal, lioness, sun disk. Tension thick in the air.

Glyphs pulse on the walls, displaying intercepted **Imperial propaganda broadcasts**, replayed at various angles.  

A broadcast voice drones over the chamber:

> **“By the will of the Emperor, mankind shall be made whole. The false gods shall be broken, and their lies cast down. Every stolen throne, reclaimed. Every corrupted relic, sanctified. The galaxy belongs to humanity—not to the worms within its skin.”**

The screen changes. Footage from *Terra*—a glittering city-planet filled with continent-sized gothic arcologies, orbital rings, and swarms of ships the size of mountains. Glimpses of **massive parades**, **billions of citizens** prostrating before golden statues of the Emperor.

Then: battle footage. **Astartes in Terminator armor** walking through rings of fire. **Kriegers** calmly advancing through chemical fog. **Imperial ships** releasing multi-mile troop barges into low orbit.

**Bastet** leans forward, tail coiled behind her throne.

> *“These are not like the Tau’ri. These are something older. Harder. They are not rebelling slaves—they are an empire of tyrants, forged in war.”*

**Yu** strokes his beard with an uncharacteristic look of unease.

> *“Their holy world... Terra. They speak of it as the center of civilization. It lies in the Galactic Core.”*

> *“A region we never reached,”* mutters **Apophis**. *“No stargates. Too dense. Too dangerous. Perhaps... seeded long before our time.”*

**Ba’al**, ever the cynic, sneers.

> *“Or this is merely Tau’ri propaganda wrapped in golden iconography. Look past the fire and brimstone—what are they, really? Just another human splinter?”*

**Ra** responds icily.

> *“No. You saw the fleets. You heard their sermons. These humans are something else. Perhaps a lost sibling of the Ancients. Or their rightful inheritors.”*

A long pause.

> *“We have stolen their tools. Worn their faces. Used their gates.”*

> *“Now they come to collect.”*

**Ra:**  
>*“You have all seen it. This... Imperium. This Holy Terra.”*

**Ba’al (smirking):**  
>*“A flair for drama, certainly. Fire. Statues. Zealotry. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?”*

**Yu (frowning):**  
>*“They speak of technology that predates even us. And they call us... parasites.”*

**Bastet:**  
>*“Because we **are**—to them. They believe their so-called Dark Age of Technology was the source of our own power. And their 'God-Emperor'... is not a person. He is an idea.”*

**Apophis:**  
>*“Lies. Manufactured mythology to justify conquest. The Tau’ri did the same, once.”*

**Ra:**  
>*“But they are not Tau’ri. They come from Terra. From the Galactic Core. Where no gate connects, and no Jaffa has ever trod. They speak of 10,000 years of empire. And their worlds are strong.”*

The silence is heavy. Even Ba’al refrains from mocking.

**Yu:**  
>*“If their claims are true… then perhaps the Ancients were not the only architects of humanity.”*

**Bastet:**  
>*“Or perhaps we have lived within another’s shadow all along.”*

**Ra (with sudden fury):**  
>*“No! We are the gods of men! **Not their inheritors!** These... ‘Imperials’ are heretics, not prophets. And if they claim the galaxy, then let them bleed for it.”*

**Ba’al (darkly amused):**  
>*“But what if they do not bleed? What if they are what they claim: the rebirth of Man’s original dominion? Then we are not gods. We are merely... squatters.”*

Uneasy silence.

*Location: The same council, deeper into the session. Glyphs flash red with reports from the front—**Imperial victories**, **rebel slave uprisings**, and **Goa’uld garrisons overrun***.

**Yu (grimly):**  
>*“Four gateworlds lost in the past cycle. Entire systems gone silent. Our garrisons overwhelmed before reinforcements could be dispatched.”*

**Apophis:**  
>*“The Imperium does not fight like the Tau’ri. They strike with precision, then dig in like termites. They build defenses, recruit the locals... and begin mining operations!”*

**Ba’al (mocking):**  
>*“Mining! How delightfully bureaucratic.”*

**Bastet (angrily):**  
>*“You mock, but our empires shrink daily. The Imperium spreads like a cancer through the stargates. We must respond now—or by the next solar alignment we will have nothing left to rule.”*

**Ra slams his fist on the console.** The lights flicker.

**Ra:**
> *“My decree is this. We unite in a mutual defense pact. If any of our holdings will be attacked, we will all respond to help defend them, and **do not** take advantage to seize these holdings for yourself”.*

**Yu (narrowly):**  
>*“You would trust us not to betray one another the moment the fleets are launched?”*

**Ra:**  
>*“The enemy stands above **all** of us. Their ships blot out the stars. Their faith makes them immune to fear. This... Imperium... is not like us. It is not a pantheon. It is a **machine.**”*

> *“We either stop the gears from turning, or we will be crushed beneath them.”*

Silence. For once, there is no debate.

**Bastet:**  
>*“Then let the system lords rise in unity. One last time.”*

The room dims, glowing in crimson. The System Lords nod one by one. War has truly begun.


**But the Goa'uld System Lords will not have time to respond to the Imperial threat, for they soon will be faced with another even more sinister, deadly, and unexpected foe.**

---

### **🌌 Scene: Pondering the Origins – A Goa'uld Crisis of Legacy**

**Location:** Private chambers of Ra, the Supreme System Lord  
**Setting:** Alone, pacing, stewing

Ra walks past flickering holograms—displays of Terra’s spire-cities, the Imperial Palace, space fleets in tight formations around massive cathedral-ships.

> “Ten thousand years. An empire ruled by a corpse... and yet they *endure*.”

He activates a screen. Footage of **Goa'uld slaves rebelling**, chanting *"For the Emperor!"* plays on loop.

Ra’s voice turns bitter:

> “The Tau’ri were a spark. This... is a firestorm.”

He looks to a **statue of an Ancient**, weathered and half-forgotten.

> “Did you leave *more* than relics behind? Did you make *them* too?”

Then, with a hiss, he strikes the statue down. It shatters at his feet.

> “If these Terrans claim to be the true heirs of mankind, then let us remind them—gods do not kneel. We make others kneel.”
