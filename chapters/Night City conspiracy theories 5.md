Thread: _Ashtar Sheran: Ghost Prophet or Galactic Psy-Op?_**

**User: ~Spectral_88**

> Okay so listen up chummers—there’s a reason why half the Concord worlds shut their gates before the Imperium even shows up, or why they never seem surprised when an Ork raid starts.  
> The name is Ashtar Sheran.  
> He’s not just some Concord cult mascot. Word is he’s got _remote viewing_—not just “seeing from afar” but like... full-on **galactic clairvoyance**.  
> Dude’s lying in a glowing trance on a marble slab in Taygeta, and watching _you_ raid a fridge on Baal Secundus.

**User: ~ByteDruid (☕ mod)**

> I’ve heard of him. Supposed to be some albino space elf with eyes like crushed sapphires.

> > Some say he's a "mentat"—a human computing machine. Like, a Pleiadian seer trained to _predict entire civilizations_.  
> > Reads behavior patterns like a spreadsheet.  
> > Knows where empires will fall five centuries in advance.  
> > If the rumors are true, this guy could outmaneuver even the Imperium's Officio Strategos before they even draw a battlemap.

**User: ~OmnissiahIsACorpAI**

> I’m telling you flat out: Sheran’s the God-Emperor if the Heresy _never happened_.  
> Perfectly calm. Immortal. Glows. Mentally connected to every psychic soul under his umbrella.  
> Except instead of building power armor, he just vibes out on a hilltop while plucking thoughts out of the aether.  
> You _can’t fight that_. The Concord doesn’t _react_ to threats—they _already saw it coming_.

**User: ~AstartesOnTheLoose**

> Yeah but come on, astral projection? What is this, space wizard fantasy hour?  
> You're telling me this guy sends ghost-clones to whisper sweet nothings into village chiefs' ears before the Imperials even step through the gate?
> 
> > Wait. That actually happened on that Rodnover world, didn’t it?

---

**User: ~ShinobiFanX9**

> Confirmed. There’s field chatter that Sheran **manipulated a spirit-gate** so the Kriegers would stumble into a Concord trap.  
> You think those gates are just teleportation? Nah. They’re **intent-based metaphysical constructs**.  
> He _let them dial in_.  
> Then watched the entire thing unfold like a pre-recorded show.  
> The entire battle was over before it started.

**User: ~Borgphobe84**

> Ironic twist?  
> He’s basically the anti-Borg.

> Imperium. Night City. Borg. All on his list.  
> He's not just watching. He's _judging_.

**User: ~TechnoCultist**

> Wait, wait. So you’re saying there’s this glowing elf guy, floating in a trance, watching all galactic events in real-time, and gently steering history to avoid soul-death?  
> And our Megacorps are trying to sell NFT sneakers while this guy is ghost-whispering entire species into spiritual enlightenment??  
> **We're so fragged.**

**User: ~DisinfoOrNot**

Thread: _True Galactic History – Insider Leak? Pleiadians, Goa’uld, and the Emperor of Mankind_**

---

**User: ~CryptArchivist777**

> 👁️**Insider here**. I used to work for a black-ops data cartel embedded in the Interplanetary Mythologics Commission.  
> All the histories you’ve ever read—curated. Sanitized.  
> Here’s what the records actually say:

- The Pleiadians were the **first gods**—not gods per se, but a high-functioning Type II spiritual civilization.  
- They arrived on scattered Earthseed worlds (Rodnover, Celtic, etc.) millennia ago via **vimanas**—living craft using mind-fold propulsion.  
- They taught the old ways: **intuition, soul-harmony, living wood tech**, anti-machine mysticism.  
- Then the **Goa’uld came.** Parasitic tyrants. Took the Pleiadian myths and twisted them into **god-king cults**.  
- They enslaved whole cultures, wore divine masks, demanded worship.  
- That’s why all your ancient gods seem contradictory.  
Because they are: **the Goa’uld plagiarized reality**.

---

**User: ~DigitalHeretic**

> Yeah right. The Pleiadians taught "soul-harmony"? More like space-elves with a superiority complex.  
> Prove they’re real. Any actual vids? Or just more crop circles and spirit-gate fanfiction?

**User: ~CathedralCommando87**

> This is heresy. There is only **one** God.

**User: ~JaffaReborn123**

> Who else could command the Ha’taks, create hosts, walk through death?  
> You Pleiadian simps just want your “soft light elf” utopia.  
> I’ll take a god I can fear, thank you.

---

**User: ~ArchivusSynthetic**

> You’re all arguing past each other.  
> Here’s a thesis:
> 
> - Goa’uld were real, powerful, and tyrannical.
> - Pleiadians were real, subtle, and philosophical.
> - **The Goa’uld stole the _symbols_**.
> - **The Pleiadians encoded the _meaning_**.  
>     That’s why every Stargate myth has two layers: one loud, flashy, brutal. One hidden, sacred, and strange.

**User: ~ImperialTruth.exe**

> All of you are fools.  
> The God-Emperor fought back the warp, unified mankind, and established the only true order.
