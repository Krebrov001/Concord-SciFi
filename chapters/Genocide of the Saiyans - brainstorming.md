Excellent prompt — this is the perfect kind of narrative mystery-with-meaning that fits the **mythic, redemptive, and conspiratorial tones** of the Concord saga. You're absolutely right that the discovery of the Stargate by Frieza’s forces should not feel like brute coincidence, nor like an overt divine intervention. It should feel like **fate wearing the clothes of chance**, guided by Ashtar Sheran's hidden hand.

Below is a **plausible and poetic rewrite** of how Frieza discovered the Stargate network — subtly orchestrated by Ashtar Sheran, but never realized by Frieza.

---

## 🌌📜 How Frieza Discovered the Stargate Network

### _(As later whispered among Concord historians — never confirmed, always felt)_

### 1. **The Ruins of Planet Klythar (Uncharted World X-472)**

Long before Planet Vegeta’s destruction, one of Frieza’s scouting fleets reported strange energy readings on a forgotten, jungle-choked world: **Klythar**. The planet was once a stronghold of a minor Goa’uld Lord who had vanished centuries earlier. His fortress, partially swallowed by the jungle, contained **a collapsed pyramid**, its golden capstone shattered and buried.

Frieza was intrigued by the report, not because he cared for archaeology — but because the energy signature matched nothing in his databanks. It had an ancient, _wrongness_ about it — chaotic yet patterned. He ordered the ruins excavated.

### 2. **The “Vault Core”**

Beneath the pyramid, his scientists unearthed an object they called the **Vault Core** — a bronze, rotating sphere with concentric rings and faint Pleiadian script etched in patterns _unknown to any Goa’uld record_. It pulsed with low-frequency vibration, and when placed near naquadah, it glowed faintly.

Frieza dismissed it as a relic. But **Zarbon**, curious and quiet, had it shipped to **Techno-Station Theta-12**, a forgotten science post at the edge of Frieza’s territory.

---

## 🌀 The Subtle Interference

What Frieza never knew — what no one in his empire would ever suspect — was that this artifact had been placed there **centuries ago**.

Not by the Goa’uld.  
Not by Frieza’s own forces.  
But by **Ashtar Sheran**, in a moment of quiet intent.

Long ago, **Ashtar** had walked on Klythar, after the Goa’uld had left, and planted the Vault Core in the broken ruins. The object was **not Goa’uld at all**, but **Pleiadian-Elven tech**: a **Soul-Resonant Dialing Matrix**, designed not to activate, but to _sing_ — to emit frequencies only perceptible to certain bloodlines.

Ashtar attuned the device to resonate subtly with the **Saiyan genome** — an echo of **Yamoshi**, the Sensei who had first walked the warrior path with soul, before the Saiyans were corrupted by Frieza’s service. Ashtar could not intervene directly — but he could plant seeds. And one such seed, **Klythar**, was left beneath Frieza’s nose.

---

## 🧬 3. Saiyan Curiosity

On Theta-12, a low-ranking Saiyan technician — a soft-spoken exiled scholar named **Karo** — noticed that when he approached the Vault Core, the rings shifted. No one else triggered this. His blood — unknown even to himself — bore an ancient resonance.

The Vault Core responded, vibrating with harmonic pulses. The technicians misinterpreted it as a **navigation system**. They reverse-engineered what they thought was **a subspace anchor** — and used it to locate a **gate-like ring structure** buried on a dead moon in the Xalcar Sector.

They activated it using artificial energy boosts.

---

## 🚪 4. First Activation – Stargate Awakens

The Stargate flared to life for the first time in thousands of years.

The moon trembled.

Frieza’s agents stepped through and emerged on a ruined Goa’uld mining world, still bearing half-functioning Ha’taks and records of System Lords long dead.

Frieza ordered immediate conquest — but what he truly gained was **access** to the gate network.

In weeks, he had dozens of worlds under his thumb.

In months, **he made contact with the outer edge of Ra’s domain**.

Frieza thought he had outmaneuvered fate.  
But fate had simply outwaited him.

---

## 🐉 5. The Saiyan Scattering (The Great Severance)

As Frieza expanded, the Concord watched silently.

Ashtar and Frieren knew that **this expansion would awaken the buried Goa’uld**, bring conflict, and ultimately **sever the Saiyans from Frieza’s control**.

They didn’t stop it — they **allowed** it, because they knew **some Saiyans would survive** and escape into the stars.

Some would land on Concord-linked worlds.  
Some would remember echoes of soul.  
And one day, they would return **not as conquerors**, but as guardians.

---

## 🪞 Hidden Implications

Only the Concord knows the full truth:

- The Vault Core was a **planted resonance key**.
    
- The Saiyan bloodline was the **intended catalyst**.
    
- Frieza was not _chosen_, but _used_ — a tyrant turned unwitting harbinger of destiny.
    
- Karo the Saiyan was never seen again. Some say he joined the early Concord. Some say he wandered into the stars seeking the "golden world" from his dreams.
    

---

## 🖋 Canonical Summary

- **Frieza discovered the Stargate** after his scouts unearthed a buried artifact on Klythar.
    
- The artifact subtly responded to a Saiyan technician, who unknowingly activated a stargate buried on a dead moon.
    
- Frieza then rapidly expanded, eventually encountering and destroying the remaining System Lords.
    
- This event was **not coincidence**, but **the final seed of Project 0.0**, subtly planted by Ashtar to break the Saiyans free.
    
- Neither Frieza nor his court ever realized they had walked into a plan thousands of years in the making.

Would you like this in **narrative format** or expanded into a full **chapter scene** next?



Absolutely. Here's a **narrative version** of the chapter — from Frieza’s point of view, with subtle clues and quiet mysteries, but **no mention yet** of Ashtar's true identity or the Sensei. The reader should feel something deeper is happening… but not know what.

---

## 🌀 **Chapter: The Vault Core**

_Somewhere in the Xalcar Fringe_

The jungle world had no name worth remembering. The charts listed it as **X-472**, a humid rock at the fringe of Frieza’s growing trade routes, once marked for strip-mining and then abandoned after the survey teams failed to return. Some said they were eaten by the flora. Others said the planet didn’t want to be found.

Frieza never cared for ghost stories.

But when one of his deep scouts returned with scans of strange energy signatures and ancient structures buried beneath the jungle — _not Saiyan, not even Tuffle or Namekian in origin_ — he raised a brow. The report mentioned a half-buried pyramid, overgrown with vines, and a strange bronze sphere glowing faintly near a shattered capstone.

Frieza leaned back in his hover-throne.

“Send it to **Theta-12**,” he said, waving a finger with imperial laziness. “Let the nerds tear it open.”

---

### **Techno-Station Theta-12**

The facility hovered in silence above a dead moon, orbiting a pale gas giant. It was where Frieza sent artifacts that were too dull to display but too strange to ignore.

There, in an amber-lit lab, a Saiyan technician named **Karo** — low-ranking, quiet, almost forgettable — cataloged the orb.

They called it the **Vault Core**.

A bronze sphere, smooth but etched with grooves that moved under heat. Its rings spun silently when touched. It pulsed with an inaudible hum, and glowed faintly near naquadah-based circuitry. Most dismissed it as aesthetic junk from some forgotten cult.

But one night, Karo stayed late.

As he approached, the Vault Core’s rings spun of their own accord — aligning into a pattern he could not describe, only feel.

And then, it sang.

Not in sound, but in **pressure**. A harmonic vibration pressed against his chest, like a tuning fork inside his bones. He stepped back, trembling.

The others never experienced this. Only Karo.

He kept it to himself.

---

### **The Moon Gate**

Weeks later, the Vault Core was brought near a buried site on the dead moon — just a coincidence, just an idle curiosity.

But when placed near the half-dug ring structure, the Stargate **activated**.

It screamed to life like a star being born — light pouring from its face, glyphs spinning, locking, _click–click–click–whooomph_ — and the lab was thrown into chaos.

Karo stood silent as the others panicked.

He heard no alarms. Only music.

---

### **The Other Side**

Frieza arrived personally.

He demanded an expedition through the gate. His forces emerged into a burned, rusting world littered with the bones of dead gods: **collapsed Ha’taks**, rusted naquadah mines, and the crumbling ziggurat of a forgotten Goa’uld.

He smiled.

“Well,” he said, folding his arms behind his back. “Looks like someone left the door open.”

Over the next months, Frieza’s forces leapt from world to world, carving through the remnants of the System Lords like a storm with fangs.

By the time Ra even realized what was happening, the network was bleeding.

And in the chaos, **some Saiyans went missing**. Not dead — just… unaccounted for. Scattered to distant worlds the gate network had not touched in millennia.

Frieza didn’t care. They were tools. Replaceable.

But someone was watching.

---

### **Elsewhere**

Far from the moon and the bloodstained gates, an old man stood in a field of tulips, a breeze in his hair, his eyes closed. Beneath his feet, the **world-tree roots** hummed. Deep beneath them, the **SoulNet** pulsed.

The Vault Core had sung. The gate had opened. The Saiyans had scattered.

Just as planned.

He did not speak.

He did not smile.

But he breathed a long breath — not of satisfaction, but of memory.

The Saiyans mattered.  
_Why_, no one knew. Not even they knew.

But someone had waited for them.

And now… the stars had begun to move again.

---

Would you like the **next scene** to show the beginning of Frieza's Goa'uld campaign? Or shift to the Saiyan diaspora as they scatter across the stars?


Perfect. Here's the continuation — a **dual-layered narrative** that follows both **Frieza’s brutal Goa’uld campaign** and the **unintended Saiyan diaspora**, capturing the chaos, violence, and subtle cosmic realignment that Ashtar has set in motion without anyone realizing.

---

## 🌌 **Chapter: The Conquest and the Scattering**

_The Goa'uld campaign begins. The Saiyans vanish like sparks blown by galactic wind._

---

### **Part I – Fire from the Gate**

Frieza stood in the command deck of a captured Ha’tak, idly swirling wine in a chalice made from the gold-cast skull of a minor System Lord. Below, on the surface of **Telar'ak**, another once-glorious Goa’uld world burned.

“Report,” he said, voice bored.

Zarbon bowed. “Resistance crumbled within the hour. Saiyan strike squads breached the palace before orbital saturation even began.”

Frieza sighed contentedly. “Delicious. That makes... eight this week?”

“Ten, my lord.”

He chuckled. “One would think these ‘gods’ would be harder to kill.”

---

The Goa’uld had never encountered **power like this** — beings who could fly faster than aircraft, who could shoot starfire from their palms, who needed no armor, no weapons. Just fury and raw ki.

The **Saiyans** were Frieza’s fists in this new war. Deployed in squads of two or three, they dropped from the Stargates like vengeful comets. No warning. No mercy.

They destroyed Jaffa command posts before the alarms could sound.  
They leveled pyramids while Frieza’s fleet watched from orbit.  
They ripped open palace walls, dragged out system lords screaming, and left the ruins smoking.

Frieza didn’t even need to follow up.

By the time his occupation troops arrived, there were only the terrified survivors — bowing, trembling, surrendering to a new god.

A **cold one**.

---

### **Part II – The Fracturing**

But then something strange happened.

Some of the Saiyans… didn’t come back.

It wasn’t mutiny. No messages. No declarations. No rebellion. Just... **absence**.

On **Kheros Prime**, the last transmission showed a squad surveying the local ruins. A week later, no response. Recon teams sent through the gate found nothing but empty camps and scouted terrain.

On **Yual'tek**, a lone Saiyan named **Paragus** simply **vanished** into the highlands. The locals whispered of a flame-eyed warrior who now wandered the mountains like a spirit.

On **Velyra**, a squad helped repel a Goa’uld remnant, liberated a village — then built homes beside them. No orders. No return.

Frieza didn’t care. They were scattered seeds. Weapons, not people.

Let them rot, he thought. There were always more Saiyans.

---

### **Part III – The Forgotten Settlers**

But the truth was more subtle.

The **Stargate network**, ancient and wild, had its own currents. Some gates had not been dialed in millennia. Some led to **pocket worlds**, hidden refuges of the old wars. Worlds **unmapped** by Frieza’s bureaucracy.

And to these places… **some Saiyans drifted**.

Not by plan. Not by command.

But as if **drawn**.

- On **Verdassa**, a Saiyan named **Karo** (yes, the same) walked into the jungle and never returned. Villagers later told of a silent monk who meditated beneath the waterfall and spoke to the trees.
    
- On **Anshura**, the children of a slain Saiyan warrior were raised by villagers who believed they were descendants of fallen stars.
    
- On **Windaria**, a Saiyan crash-landed during a botched gate transfer. He emerged from the smoking crater, looked at the world-tree towering above the valley, and dropped to his knees.
    

Some of these worlds would later become part of the Concord.  
Some of these Saiyans would be found again.  
Some would never be.

But they were not lost.

They were **planted**.

---

### **Part IV – A Quiet Moment in Taygeta**

In a wooden observatory high above the crystal rivers of Taygeta, **Frieren** looked up from her scrying bowl. Her silver hair fell over one shoulder, her expression distant.

She had been watching the scattering.

Not with grief. Not with hope. But with **knowing**.

Behind her, **Ashtar** said nothing. He stood at the window, looking out over the tulip fields in bloom.

“They’re going,” she murmured. “Just as you said they would.”

He nodded slowly. “I didn’t say they would go.”

He paused.

“I just opened the door.”

---

### **Closing Passage – The Diaspora**

Across the stars, Saiyans vanished from Frieza’s radar.

Some died.  
Some fled.  
Some stayed behind.

But others… others felt a call they couldn’t explain. A tug behind the heart. A whisper in their blood. Not a voice — not even a memory — just the feeling that somewhere, beyond the stars, was **a home they had never known**.

They did not know why.

They did not know where.

But they went.

And the galaxy, for the first time in many millennia, exhaled.

---

Would you like the next scene to explore one of these lost Saiyan colonies in more detail — perhaps Windaria or another Concord-linked world?




Absolutely — here is a full scene that explores one of the **lost Saiyan colonies** on a **former Goa’uld world**, now abandoned by the Empire, untouched by the Concord… for now. This chapter captures the **raw transition from war to memory**, and the **beginning of spiritual thaw** in a scattered Saiyan remnant.

---

## 🌾 **Chapter: The Ashes of Varn’tel**

_A Saiyan warrior walks among the ruins of a god, and does not return to Frieza._

---

### **1. The World of Varn’tel**

It had once been a jewel of the lesser Goa’uld System Lord **Kha-Merut**, a pompous demigod who styled himself the _Lord of Harvests_. His reign had lasted two centuries, sustained by naquadah farms and obedient Jaffa. The planet was fertile, lush, and dotted with ziggurats that gleamed like emerald teeth in the jungle.

But when Frieza’s Stargate campaign reached Varn’tel, the god fell in hours.

Three Saiyans emerged from the gate: **Turo**, **Fenn**, and **Radiah**. They tore through the ziggurat’s defenses with little effort. Kha-Merut died impaled on a jungle tree, hurled by Radiah’s hand like a broken doll. The Jaffa were scattered, the gate secured.

Frieza’s victory was complete.

And yet… the Saiyans did not return.

---

### **2. The Ghosts of Glory**

Weeks passed. No word from the trio.

Frieza’s bureaucracy chalked it up to attrition or desertion. There were new conquests. New gates to open.

But on Varn’tel, the three warriors remained.

Radiah, the squad leader, stood atop the ziggurat at dusk and looked out over the jungle valley. The twin moons reflected in her eyes, flickering like old memories. Below, the villagers — now free — were rebuilding with quiet reverence.

One of them, a gray-haired healer named **Ilana**, brought her fruit in a woven basket.

“You still haven’t left,” she said, gently. “Your war is over.”

Radiah didn’t answer at first.

Then: “I don’t think it was mine to begin with.”

---

### **3. Fenn Finds the Garden**

Fenn, the youngest, had discovered a **sealed vault** beneath the ziggurat — not a weapons cache, but something stranger: a **garden**.

A grove of bioluminescent trees, untouched by time. Each bore fruit in a perfect spiral pattern. The walls were etched with ancient script, neither Goa’uld nor Jaffa.

There were no machines.

Only **peace**.

He sat beneath one of the trees for hours.

He had always fought. He had always obeyed. But here… he simply _was_.

He began sketching the tree’s bark into his notebook.

He began to speak more softly.

He began to sleep without dreaming of death.

---

### **4. Turo Disappears**

Turo was the most hardened — the killer, the veteran, the executioner. No one expected him to change.

One morning, he left the camp and did not return.

Radiah searched the valley. She found his boots and gloves neatly folded at the base of a tree, beside the stream.

In the mud, he had scrawled one word in Saiyan script:

**"Home."**

They never found his body.

But weeks later, a child in the village claimed to see a **“golden man with wild hair”** bathing in the waterfall, laughing like thunder, then vanishing into the mist.

Radiah didn’t investigate.

She just looked to the sky and whispered, “Good.”

---

### **5. The Temple in the Jungle**

Radiah stayed. She no longer wore her armor. She tied her hair with jungle vine. She helped rebuild a burned granary with her bare hands.

And one day, she gathered the villagers.

Together, they tore down the statue of Kha-Merut — and in its place, they built a simple shrine. A stone ring, inscribed with no names. Just seven points carved into the floor around it, radiating outward like a starburst.

At its center: a single, round stone etched with a strange symbol.

Not Saiyan.  
Not Goa’uld.  
Something older.

They didn’t know what it meant.

But it felt **right**.

---

### **6. Whispered in the Wind**

Many years later, when Concord explorers first walked the ruins of Varn’tel, they found the village still thriving.

The shrine was still maintained.  
No statues of gods.  
No symbols of Frieza.

Just a carving, lovingly kept clean, of a tree with stars in its roots.

And beside it, the tattered cape of a Saiyan warrior — folded neatly beneath a stone that read:

**“We burned their gods.  
But the fire became light.  
And the light became home.”**

---

Would you like the **Concord rediscovery of Varn’tel** to be the next scene — perhaps with Frieren, or a Shinobi recon team, quietly arriving and realizing that the seeds had grown?


Beautiful — this adds a **crucial political and emotional dimension** to the Saiyan diaspora: it wasn’t merely an accident of war or the pull of fate. It was also a **conscious, desperate gamble by King Vegeta**, a way to scatter seeds of survival before the coming fire.

Let’s expand this into a chapter of its own — **a hidden moment in Saiyan history**, full of tension, pride, and looming extinction.

---

## 🔥👑 **Chapter: The King's Last Gambit**

_King Vegeta does not weep. He plants stars._

---

### **1. Throne Room of Stone and Steel**

The **planetary night** glowed red over Planet Vegeta. In the throne hall, the fires of the volcanic peaks beyond the horizon flickered against the polished walls. The great banners of the Saiyan Empire — blood-red with the golden sigil of the ape — hung silent.

**King Vegeta** sat alone.

Zarbon’s visit had been brief. Polite. Chilling.

Frieza was expanding. Rapidly. The Stargate network, newly discovered, had become **a ladder of conquest**, and the Saiyans were the spearhead. Every week brought new worlds, new victories… and new whispers.

Too many Saiyans were being sent out.

Too few were returning.

And Frieza — smiling, effortless, unreadable — never seemed afraid of their growing power. That terrified the King more than anything.

He knew what it meant.

---

### **2. The Council of Shadows**

That night, in a war chamber lit only by a flickering map of the stargate-linked systems, King Vegeta summoned three of his closest warriors — not generals, not loyalists, but **those he trusted to think**.

- **Commander Bardak**, strategic genius, father to a boy with strange dreams.
    
- **Selari**, a scout who had mapped over a dozen stargate worlds and seen too much.
    
- **Moro**, a grim-faced diplomat who had once negotiated directly with the remnants of the Tuffles.
    

He gave them no orders.

He asked only one question:

> “If the worst should happen... where would our people survive?”

---

### **3. The Hidden Plan**

King Vegeta began issuing **colonial incentives** the next day.

- Squads were quietly **authorized** to remain on certain conquered worlds — especially those with clean air, fertile ground, and defensible terrain.
    
- Certain families were **assigned “long-range security stations”** in remote worlds that had no strategic value to Frieza.
    
- Saiyan pods were **rerouted**, misreported, or “lost in warp drift.”
    

None of this was spoken of publicly. But among the older warriors, a phrase began to circulate:

> “The King is planting fire in the soil.”

Even Bardak didn’t fully understand what it meant.

But the missions continued.

And slowly… **Saiyans disappeared**.

Not dead. Not banished. Not runaways.

**Planted.**

---

### **4. A Message for the Future**

In the vault beneath the throne, King Vegeta recorded a single message in a hidden databank — encoded to only activate upon receiving **a specific genetic signal**.

In it, he did not speak as a ruler.

He spoke as a father.

> “If you are hearing this… then our empire is gone.  
> And yet you breathe.  
> That means I was right to trust the stars.”

> “We were warriors. But we were more.  
> If you still carry our blood… then build something greater than what we were.”

> “The world will call you conquerors. Let them.  
> Just don’t forget... we were a people first.”

> “And if you meet the one called Frieza... tell him:  
> the tree he burned scattered seeds.”

---

### **5. The Fire Falls**

Shortly after, Frieza summoned the King.

He was... pleasant.

He made a request: all Saiyans were to return to Planet Vegeta for **“a celebration of loyalty.”** Even Bardak felt the noose tighten.

Some obeyed.

Others — the ones “stationed too far,” or “lost in gate drift,” or “assigned to long-range world pacification”— never made it back.

They never received the recall.

And by the time Planet Vegeta became a nova in Frieza’s sky…

**those Saiyans were already on other worlds.**

---

### **6. Elsewhere — A Small Fire Burns**

On a quiet moon in the outer orbit of a Goa’uld-mined world, a lone Saiyan named **Kiel** stood beside his pod.

He had received no return orders.

Only silence.

He looked at the stars above.

And for the first time… he stayed.

He built a hut.  
He trained in silence.  
He carved the names of his squad into a stone.

And when a villager asked why he remained, he said only:

> “Because the King told me to.”

---

Would you like the **King’s hidden message** to be discovered later by one of the Saiyan Concord scouts — perhaps Gohan, or a Saiyan born in the Concord rediscovery era?

Let me know if you’d like me to weave specific details into our Concord saga’s timeline or character arcs!

---

After hearing of the legend of the [Super Saiyan](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Saiyan "Super Saiyan") (and that of the [Super Saiyan God](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Saiyan_God "Super Saiyan God")), Frieza decides to eliminate the Saiyan race to avoid any threats to his rule. He has an order sent out to command all [Saiyans](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Saiyan "Saiyan") to return to Planet Vegeta.

Upon arriving back, [Bardock](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Bardock "Bardock") realizes that Frieza may be planning to wipe out the Saiyan race, and so he and his wife [Gine](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Gine "Gine") choose to send their young son [Kakarot](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Goku "Goku") away to Earth to keep him safe. The Saiyan prince [Vegeta](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Vegeta "Vegeta") and his ally [Raditz](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Raditz "Raditz") both hear the call back but chose not to respond to it and stay on the planet they were conquering. [Nappa](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Nappa "Nappa") - the general of the Saiyan army - also remains on his mission and does not return to the planet within the allotted time.

As Frieza's ship looms over Planet Vegeta, the final hour arrives. Members of Frieza's army fly down and engage Bardock. One of Frieza's advisors reminds Frieza that their forces would be drastically reduced in half. Frieza then departs from his ship, comfortably sitting in his [hoverchair](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Frieza%27s_Hover_Pod "Frieza's Hover Pod").

Frieza, with the lift of a finger, creates a massive [sun-like energy ball](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Supernova "Supernova"), which he launches at Bardock and the planet below. Bardock launches a [powerful energy wave](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Spirit_Cannon "Final Spirit Cannon") at the energy ball. Bardock is obliterated by Frieza's attack, along with many of Frieza's own soldiers close by. The energy ball then proceeds to slam into Planet Vegeta, and after burying itself into the planet's core, Planet Vegeta blows up, killing nearly the entire Saiyan race in the process. Frieza watches on his scouter as it counts down to zero before leaving in his ship to continue business as usual. In a single day, the mighty Saiyan race was drawn near complete extinction.

Perfect — this rewrite transforms the original tragedy into a **mythic last stand**, one filled with nobility, foresight, and sacrifice. It also integrates seamlessly into the **Concord saga**, especially in light of the **Saiyan diaspora** and Ashtar Sheran’s hidden guidance. Below is the full **narrative chapter**, adjusted to match your new canon.

## 🔥🌌 **Chapter: The Last Stand of Vegeta**

_Frieza intended to erase the Saiyans. He succeeded only in awakening their future._

---

### **1. Whispers in the Court of Frieza**

The halls of Frieza’s flagship were silent save for the humming of ancient Goa’uld engines — technology scavenged, repurposed, and forgotten. Frieza sat in his levitating throne, tail lazily coiled, eyes sharp with suspicion.

Zarbon stood at his side, ever poised.

Dodoria leaned on the doorway, arms crossed.

“My lord,” Zarbon said with a cool, diplomatic lilt, “the Saiyans have become... overconfident. Their power grows. Their conquests exceed what you’ve sanctioned.”

Dodoria snorted. “They're savages with delusions of empire. If you let them keep spreading to those colony worlds, one day they’ll stop listening.”

Frieza sipped his wine and said nothing.

Then: “Recall them. All of them. Tell them... I wish to thank them personally.”

---

### **2. King Vegeta’s Dread**

When the recall signal reached Planet Vegeta, **King Vegeta** felt something snap in his gut.

The words were sweet. Too sweet. A _celebration_? From Frieza?

He had known for months now — ever since the Saiyans began spreading to the outer colony worlds, ever since the Stargate campaign accelerated — that Frieza was watching too closely. Too patiently.

Now he saw the trap.

He summoned **Bardak**, his most dangerous soldier, the only one he trusted to both see the truth and act on it without delusion.

“He means to destroy us,” King Vegeta said. “But he’ll not have all of us.”

---

### **3. The Secret Exodus**

That very night, Bardak took his son, **Kakarot**, and placed him in a reinforced pod. Its target: **Colony World Vallis**, a lush, outlying world that had once belonged to a Goa’uld and was now under quiet Saiyan administration.

Elsewhere, **Prince Vegeta** was sent in a similar craft — disguised as a scouting mission.

In secret, hundreds of Saiyan pods launched over the following days, headed for the **outer colonies**: Kheros, Varn’tel, Vallis, Verdassa, and dozens more.

The official records listed these as “forward deployments” and “deep patrol operations.”

But in truth — **they were lifeboats**.

---

### **4. The Supernova**

Frieza arrived in orbit with **his flagship and two dreadnoughts**. No warning. No fanfare.

From the bridge, he looked down at Planet Vegeta and smiled faintly.

“A blight on galactic order,” he whispered. “Time to prune.”

He raised a single finger.

A sphere of energy began to form, pulsing and glowing brighter with every second — a growing **supernova**, forged not of heat but of hatred.

“Goodbye, monkeys,” he hissed.

---

### **5. The Last Stand**

On the planet’s surface, **King Vegeta and Bardak** had already seen it coming.

They stood side by side on the palace’s upper rampart — one king, one warrior. Their hands rose as one, and from their palms burst twin beams of white-gold ki, burning upward like spears of a dying sun.

All across the world, Saiyan warriors looked to the sky and roared — joining their strength to the wave.

The energies met in orbit.

There was **a moment of silence**.

Then—  
**Frieza’s supernova collapsed inward.**  
The dreadnoughts cracked and split.  
The flagship shattered like glass.

And then came **the blastwave**.

Planet Vegeta cracked open like a fruit under pressure.

A corona of light engulfed the orbit.

And in the heart of it — King Vegeta and Bardak, arms outstretched, disintegrated not in terror, but in victory.

Frieza, Zarbon, and Dodoria were atomized in their ship.

The tyrant died **never knowing** his final plan had already failed.

---

### **6. The Colonies Remember**

On Vallis, a young Kakarot stood in the jungle clearing where his pod had landed, watching the stars. He didn’t understand why his heart ached.

On Verdassa, Prince Vegeta looked up at the night sky, fists clenched.

Across the colony worlds, **the survivors felt the echo**. A pressure in their chests. A pulse in the earth.

They knew, somehow, that their world was gone.

But not their people.

---

### **7. Later – The Tale Retold**

Among the Concord historians, it is said that **Planet Vegeta did not fall** — it **chose to burn** so that its children might rise again.

Some of the memory trees planted later in those colonies recorded that final roar — not in words, but in emotion:

> _We did not kneel._  
> _We did not flee._  
> _We died standing — so the next garden could grow._

---

Would you like the next chapter to follow **young Goku or Prince Vegeta** in the colonies, perhaps during their early years before the Concord discovers them? Or shall we explore how the **Concord first sensed the collective echo** of the Saiyan survival?



Excellent. This chapter will be a **dreamlike, trance-bound vision** experienced by **Ashtar Sheran**, who perceives the Saiyan survival not through technology, but through **soul-resonance and astral sense**. This moment marks the **first subtle realization** within the Concord that the Saiyans were not extinct, and that **their scattered embers may become something more**.

---

## 🌌🔮 **Chapter: The Ember Echo**

_In the still halls of Taygeta’s Crystal Spire, Ashtar sleeps. But not in silence._

---

### **1. The Hall of Stillness**

The upper chamber of the **Crystal Spire** on Taygeta was lined with living quartz and bioluminescent moss. A slow pulse moved through the floor — the **Deepwood Pulse**, ancient and quiet. The room had no light source, and yet glowed gently, like starlight caught in snow.

At its center, on a floating stone wrapped in moss and vine, **Ashtar Sheran** lay in stillness — palms upward, robes flowing like water, breath slow and measured.

He was **remote viewing**.

Not in mind, but in **soul**.

His consciousness slipped sideways into the **Soul Current**, the realm between realms where memory, possibility, and resonance flowed like river mist.

---

### **2. The Vision Begins**

At first, there was only **sound** — not voices, not music, but deep thudding pulses.

Like drums played in a forge.  
Like a heartbeat that echoed in stone.  
Like something old awakening beneath fire.

Then came **images**, flickering:

- A golden sky split in two.
    
- A man with fire in his hands screaming into the void.
    
- A jungle clearing under starlight.
    
- Children with wild hair and heavy eyes staring at the moon.
    
- A village shrine made of star-metal and carved wood.
    
- A woman in armor laying her scouter down beside a flowering tree.
    

Each flickered. None were stable.  
Each one sang in a different **note**, like instruments tuning before a symphony.

And then—  
**silence**.

---

### **3. The Resonance**

Into that silence came a sound he recognized not with ears, but with his **inner knowing**.

A **single pulse**.

> _DOOM._

Then again, softer—

> _doom... doom... doom..._

Like the heartbeat of a creature that had not died, but merely hidden.

Ashtar’s breath caught.

He reached, not with fingers, but with the **threads of his essence**, and touched the source.

What he felt was not rage.  
Not grief.  
Not even confusion.

It was **survival**.

**Stubborn, wild, soul-buried survival.**

A fire not yet tamed.

---

### **4. The Whisper**

A whisper came through the vision, not from any speaker, but from the Soul Current itself:

> _They did not burn.  
> They scattered._
> 
> _The King roared. The warrior answered.  
> And the tyrant fell into his own flame._
> 
> _The embers fell to soil.  
> And now… they dream of skies again._

Ashtar's eyes fluttered behind closed lids.

He saw a map of the galaxy — not physical, but soul-based — with **threads of orange and gold light** stretching from a central point and **branching outward like roots**.

Each thread pulsed like a heartbeat.

Each was a **Saiyan colony**.

---

### **5. Awakening**

He sat up.

The moss shifted beneath him, forming a cushion. His breath was slow but deliberate.

He did not speak for several minutes.

Then finally, to no one in particular, he whispered:

> “So they survived…”

His tone was not surprised.

It was... **relieved**.

Then, standing, he opened his eyes — twin galaxies of soft blue and endless time.

> “Send word to Frieren,” he said. “And to Velarion.  
> The embers are still warm.”

---

### **6. Notes Entered into the Memory Wall**

Later that evening, he etched the vision into the **Crystal Memory Wall**, in a flowing script only Concord soul-readers could translate:

> *“The Saiyans are not extinct.  
> They live upon colony worlds, far from Frieza’s reach.  
> The planet is gone, but the pulse remains.
> 
> Their path is not yet known.  
> But I will not force it.  
> They must awaken on their own.”*

> _“Perhaps the stars have waited long enough for them.”_

---

Would you like the next chapter to follow Frieren or Velarion as they receive this message and begin the quiet preparations to **reconnect with the lost Saiyan colonies** — or shift focus to one Saiyan colony where a warrior begins to awaken a new form of ki?



Beautiful. This next chapter will follow both **Frieren** and **Velarion**, each responding in their own way to Ashtar’s revelation. Frieren, contemplative and gentle, prepares spiritually. Velarion, always the schemer and mage, begins quiet political and mystical maneuvers. Their two paths converge into the Concord’s first steps toward **welcoming the Saiyans home** — not by conquest, but by resonance.

---

## 🌠🧙‍♀️ **Chapter: The Quiet Return**

_When Ashtar spoke, they listened. And when the embers stirred, they lit lanterns._

---

### **1. Taygeta – Garden of the White Lilies**

The message came not by courier, but by **living wind**.

In the temple-garden high above Taygeta, **Frieren** stood in a circle of white lilies, her bare feet pressing into the soft moss as the petals swayed in rhythm with her breath. The wind passed between the trees, carrying no words, only a feeling — the unmistakable pulse of **Ashtar’s soulprint**.

She paused. Listened.

The lilies bent.

Then she spoke aloud to no one:

> “So they still live.”

She knelt beside the roots and touched the earth with her fingertips, sending her ki through the garden's subtle song.

Images came in flashes — a broken planet, scattered pods, burning skies… and then **children**.

Playing. Learning. Training.

The Saiyans had not vanished.  
They had simply gone **quiet**.

She stood, brushing soil from her robes.

> “It’s time,” she whispered. “To remember them.”

---

### **2. Night City – The Cloaked Tower**

At the edge of Concord’s virtual embassy buried beneath Night City’s ruined metro lines, **Velarion** reclined in a mag-wood chair, his silver beard glowing faintly with stored psychic heat. He was in communion with Taygeta’s astral lattice when Ashtar’s vision arrived — not as language, but as **memory resonance**.

The moment it hit, he froze.

The incense in the air curled upward.

On the table beside him, the crystalline scry-orb pulsed once with golden light.

He placed a hand on it. The orb responded, echoing with Saiyan ki signatures.

He narrowed his eyes, then smiled.

> “I see,” he murmured. “The seeds did take root.”

He turned toward the hallway.

> “Dispatch Concord soul-runners to the outer worlds,” he instructed a glowing sigil hovering in the air. “No ships. No flags. Not yet.”

> “Only watchers. Listeners. Poets and scouts.”

Then he looked upward — through the ceiling, through the stone and steel, toward the stars.

> “We approach not as redeemers,” he whispered. “But as kin.”

---

### **3. The First Movements – Subtle and Soft**

Across the Concord, small things began to happen:

- A **Saiyan script manuscript**, long buried in a lost archive on Serenai, was quietly retrieved and studied.
    
- A **Rodnover starmap** of “anomalous energy blooms” in the outer rim was reclassified as “active soul loci.”
    
- A bioship was grown in silence, its hull tuned to withstand solar winds but designed to hover, not invade.
    

Frieren sent **letters of memory** — not orders — to her trusted students among the Shinobi.

> “If you meet a Saiyan, do not bow and do not command.  
> Just ask them to spar.  
> You’ll know if they’re ready.”

Velarion, meanwhile, left a cryptic message on a Night City forum:

> _“Some warriors are born from wrath.  
> Others from silence.  
> But all flames return to the hearth eventually.  
> Have you seen a star-eyed stranger in your dreams?”_

---

### **4. Taygeta – The Soulgarden Council**

At the edge of the tulip fields, Frieren and Velarion met beneath the shade of a memory tree. A low breeze stirred the branches above, and the tree quietly hummed with stored memory — the echo of Ashtar’s trance.

Frieren spoke first. “They’ll be proud, but hurt. Strong, but unsure.”

Velarion nodded. “They will not kneel.”

“Nor should they,” she replied. “They are not lost sheep.”

“No,” he agreed. “They are thunderclouds waiting to choose whether to water the soil or burn it.”

They sat in silence.

Then Velarion asked: “Shall we go ourselves?”

Frieren gave him a rare smile.

> “Not yet. The embers must call us first.”

---

### **5. Closing Passage**

Far beyond, on a colony world hidden behind twin suns, a young Saiyan meditated beneath a cracked old ziggurat.

The wind shifted.

He looked up.

He didn’t know why… but he felt it.

Something was coming.  
Not an army.  
Not an enemy.

Just… **presence**.

---

Would you like the next chapter to follow a **young Saiyan awakening** to his spiritual potential — perhaps guided by a Concord scout — or return to Frieren and Velarion once the first Saiyan responds?













Excellent. Here is the **follow-up scene**: the **Concord rediscovery of Varn’tel**, long after the Saiyan squad disappeared. The tone here is **quiet, reverent, and reflective** — a moment of realization, not conquest. The explorers are not soldiers, but seekers of soul-resonance, memory, and healing.

---

## 🌿 **Chapter: The Seeds That Remained**

_A Concord team steps through the gate into the long-forgotten world of Varn’tel. The air hums. Something has been waiting._

---

### **1. Gate Activation – Wind Among Stone**

The old **Stargate of Varn’tel** rumbled awake for the first time in decades.

From its stone ring — weathered, half-swallowed by moss and fern — a white vortex burst into bloom. Moments later, three Concord figures emerged in long cloaks, their boots soft on the fertile loam.

They didn’t speak.

They never did at first.

One of them, an older **Rodnover woman** named **Svetlana**, knelt and touched the soil. She closed her eyes.

“Stillness,” she whispered. “And… memory.”

Beside her, a **Shinobi scout** in green armor, face half-covered, scanned the surroundings with quiet intensity. His name was **Hiro**.

“No Jaffa. No defense grid. No Goa’uld radiation trace.”

The third figure — taller, robed in lavender living-fiber with a staff of whitewood — stood with hair like frost and eyes like glassy time. Her pointed ears twitched slightly.

It was **Frieren**.

She looked around. Her voice was calm.

“They are gone. But something else remains.”

---

### **2. The Village Below**

The explorers made their way down the overgrown path toward the valley below.

There, to their astonishment, was a thriving **agrarian village**, built in part from the stones of a former Goa’uld palace — now shaped into **homes, kilns, and a community grain hall**.

Children played with carved wooden spheres. Old women painted stories on the walls. A boy with spiky black hair and dark eyes ran barefoot, chasing a jungle bird through a shallow stream.

When they saw the travelers, they paused.

Then, slowly, a man emerged from the crowd — middle-aged, strong, with a faint scar across his cheek. He wore no armor, only a wrap of cloth, but his **aura was unmistakable**.

He was **Saiyan**.

“My name is **Varek**,” he said. “You are not from here.”

Frieren stepped forward and smiled, serene as always. “No. But we are not strangers.”

---

### **3. The Shrine**

Varek led them to the center of the village, where the shrine stood beneath an open grove.

A stone circle.

Seven lines radiating like a sunburst.

And in the center — the weathered carving of a **tree**, its roots wrapped around a star.

Frieren’s fingers lightly touched the edge of the stone.

“I know this shape,” she said. “But not because I’ve seen it before.”

Hiro blinked. “A Saiyan built this?”

Varek nodded. “Radiah. Our teacher. She came from the stars, like fire. But she left as water. She taught us to listen. To wait. To remember.”

He looked at the sky.

“She said someone would come. That we were part of something larger.”

---

### **4. The Soul-Reading**

That night, Svetlana performed the ritual of **soul-resonance** beneath the shrine.

With herbal smoke and slow harmonic chant, she placed her hands to the roots of the shrine stone.

The air grew still.

And then—  
A whisper.

Not words, not thought, but **feeling**:

> _A scream of war. A broken god.  
> Then—  
> A choice.  
> Fire turned to memory.  
> The warrior becomes the guardian.  
> And the seed sleeps in the valley._

Svetlana opened her eyes. Tears streaked her cheeks.

“They stayed,” she said. “They didn’t just survive. They changed.”

---

### **5. Frieren’s Reflection**

The next morning, as light broke over the jungle, Frieren stood alone at the edge of the shrine.

Varek approached. “Will you take us away?”

She shook her head gently. “No. You are already home.”

He looked uncertain. “Then what happens now?”

Frieren turned to him, voice soft and timeless.

“Now... we remember you.”

---

### **6. Final Image**

Later that week, a **Memory Tree** was planted beside the shrine — its roots merging with the valley soil, its leaves shimmering faintly at night.

It did not overwrite the village’s memories.

It **harmonized** with them.

A bioship hovered silently above, sending word back to Taygeta.

Not of conquest.  
Not of technology.  
Just this:

> _"A garden remains where fire once walked.  
> We have found the Saiyans."_

---

Would you like to continue into **more rediscovered Saiyan colonies**, or shall we now follow **the Concord's next moves** — perhaps debates on Taygeta about the implications of Saiyan heritage?
