**Imperial Propaganda Broadcast — Segment Excerpt:**  
*“Rejoice, children of Man, for you are heirs to the most glorious civilization in the galaxy — the Imperium of Man, forged in fire, sanctified in blood, and shielded by the divine will of the Immortal God-Emperor. From Holy Terra, cradle of Mankind and sacred beacon of purity, flows the Light of the Emperor, piercing warp and void to unite trillions beneath His righteous gaze. Our fleets are the sword of humanity, our faith the shield, and our destiny unassailable. We are the hammer that smites heresy, the torch that banishes darkness. There is no salvation beyond the Imperium, for it is the heart, the soul, and the eternal empire of Mankind!”*

So... they're literally worshipping a dead guy hooked up to a chair for ten thousand years? And they think *we're* the degenerates?

**[User: NoLifeNeuralist]**  
Read between the lines. It's classic centralization of power: frame the homeworld as divine, make loyalty a religious act. Then paint everyone else as heretical. Honestly feels more like a memetic firewall than a belief system.

**[User: Synesthesia.Crow]**  
"The light of the Emperor pierces the warp" — translation: they can barely navigate their ships without a psychic nightlight. Their tech is more prayer than science.

**[User: HollowCityDreamer]**  
You guys joke, but if the Concord hadn’t warned us, I’d be impressed. Glorious might, holy cradle, eternal empire… this is mythmaking on an industrial scale.

**[User: Shaderunner0]**  
Industrial *death* scale. If that’s the heart of humanity, maybe we’re better off heartless. Give me tree-ships and talking deer gods over corpse-emperor fascism any day.

New headline just dropped: “BREAKING — Holy Terra Glows in the Dark (and Not from Enlightenment).” 😂

**[User: CyberSatyr]**  
LMAO. You ever actually *seen* raw footage of Terra? It’s not gold domes and choirs — it’s miles of smog-choked ruin, hive towers eating each other, and a million people dying just to turn on a lightbulb.  

**[User: DustRogue42]**  
Insider here. I cracked a few fragments from old Imperium archive packets years ago — “nutritional rations” on Terra? *Corpse starch.* Literally ground up humans. Billions die, and they get recycled into food paste. “From flesh we are born, to the Throne we return.” It’s a closed-loop society.  

**[User: Shaderunner0]**  
Corpse starch?? I thought that was a meme.  
Wait… are you telling me that’s *real?*

**[User: DustRogue42]**  
Very. Real. Why do you think no xeno species wants to share a table with them? You can smell the entropy. And decay.

**[User: MemeLancer_Ex]**  
Just uploaded: “Corpse-Starch Crunch” cereal meme. Emperor on the box. Tagline: “Breakfast of heretics.” 😏

**[User: NeonYogi]**  
What gets me is the layers of cognitive dissonance. You worship a man who hated being worshipped. You fear decay so much you calcify your culture. And you feed your people the dead — but call *others* primitive?

**[User: GhostSynapse]**  
Terra is a spiritual mausoleum pretending to be a lighthouse. The Concord offers rebirth. The Imperium offers embalming. Choose wisely.  

**[User: ArcadiaBloom]**  
I’m just here wondering how long before the Concord gets blamed for the corpse starch scandal going viral. You *know* the Imperium’s gonna accuse “leaf-worshipping psykers” of corrupting Terra’s sacred nutrition program. 😐  

**[User: VoxPopuliHax]**  
Too late. Already saw a new Imperium cast: “The Green Heresy poisons our rations with subversive thought.” I'm dying. 💀

“Corpse starch” sounds horrific till you remember we’ve been eating flavor-modified plastic noodles and synthetic meat grown in vats of hormone-rich gel since birth. Let’s not throw too many rocks in this glass high-rise.

---

**[User: BioRebel4]**  
Nah, corpse starch is still worse. But you’re right — I checked the label on my meal bar yesterday: 17% protein, 24% neural suppressants, 39% artificial preservatives.  
And 100% despair. This ain’t food. It’s *fodder*.

**[User: ByteGrind]**  
You ever notice how we laugh more about corpse starch than we do about our own food? Because we *can’t* look at our own plate. At least the Imperium is honest about eating the dead. We eat death and call it “nutritionally complete.”

**[User: CyberYuki]**  
The question isn’t “Would you eat corpse starch?”  
The question is “Haven’t you already?”  
Just with better branding.

**[User: SynthFaithless]**  
They say in the Concord, children help grow the food they eat. They touch the earth. They pray not to gods, but to the harmony of life itself.  
Here, we sell ads on meal wrappers and call it culture.

**[User: VoxPopuliHax]**  
Funniest thing? You know the corps say Concord veggies “haven’t been sterilized or gene-locked for safety.” As if real food is a *health hazard*.

**[Leaked Thread | SubNet Layer 3 | “GrayFiles_Delta” | Anonymous Source Drop]**

> **Title: They Fear the Roots — Internal Briefing on Concord Containment**

**[Anonymous Post Begins]**

You don’t know me, and you never will. But I work high enough in Arasaka’s Strategic Cultural Division to have seen the memetic threat reports. The ones labeled *Black Lotus Protocols*. They’re not about war. Not guns. Not even about tech theft.

They’re about **ideology**.

The Concord isn’t invading. It’s *unplugging*. It's spreading *slowly*, like roots beneath the concrete. In forum posts. In poetry. In young people abandoning implants. In workers refusing booster schedules and turning off their consumer feeds.  
They don't shout. They just *walk away*.

Executives across corps—Arasaka, Zetatech, Biotechnica—we had an emergency summit last week. The key phrase?  
> “The Concord undermines our cultural architecture of control.”

What that means is: their *way of life* breaks the system we built.

We don’t need slaves with chains. We engineered better methods:  
- **Dependency on augmentation**  
- **Addictive, personalized pleasure loops**  
- **Advertised dreams tailored to break your will**  
- **Wage cages framed as 'freedom of choice'**

We took your *soul*, called it a “user profile,” and monetized it.

But Ashtar Sheran… yeah, that name came up. They called him a “memetic vector of deindustrial regression.”  
They said he’s **dangerous** because he speaks of **freedom with meaning**, not freedom to consume. Because he warns about **hedonistic prisons in neon light**.  
He offers a *path home*, and they hate him for it.

Why do you think we mock the Concord?  
Why do we call them “space druids” and “tree-huggers”?  
Because if people *actually listen*, the whole system begins to **wither**.

They don’t need guns to defeat us.  
They just need you to *believe you can live without us*.

That’s what terrifies them.

This hits like a neural spike. I always knew the Concord wasn’t just “quaint.” It’s *post-civilization*. Post-corp. That’s the real threat.

**@ExCogneticsDrone**  
> “They don’t shout. They just walk away.”  
Goddamn. That line. That’s rebellion without violence. That’s *hope*.

**@VerdantCircuitry**  
We laughed at Ashtar. We memed about “bioships” and “wooden huts.”  
But maybe they aren’t behind. Maybe we’ve *run too far ahead* and lost the forest entirely.

**@OffGridNomad**  
They call it regression. I call it *reconnection*.

Whoever dropped that... it’s already being graffiti-tagged on synth walls in Watson and run through audio loops on pirate stations. People are feeling it. Like a low thrum in the guts of the city.

**@BitCrushSaint**  
I walked through Japantown today. Chrome, lights, noise... but it all felt hollow. After reading that leak, I just saw cages. Gilded with ads. We’re livestock—fat, augmented, pacified.

**@FissionHearted**  
Corp food is corpse starch with a different brand logo.  
You think your burger grew anywhere natural?  
One taste of Concord vegetables, and you *remember*. You *remember what food was* before it became textured nutrient slurry flavored by algorithms.

**@RogueSapien**  
Ashtar said, *“Chains forged from pleasure are still chains.”*  
Makes sense now. The game was never freedom. It was always about *dependency*. You think you want upgrades? You *need* them—because your body, your mind, your soul’s been made to *fail* without them.

**@VeritasNoir**  
They taught us to crave implants like addicts.  
The Concord teaches people to listen to silence.  
We mocked them. Called them tree-huggers. But what they have—it's not regression. It’s *sanity*.

**@BioForgeDissent**  
Ever since the leak, I've seen more eyes look up from screens.  
People staring out windows. Asking questions.  
The cracks are forming.  
All it takes is a little truth—dripped slow like acid—and the whole megastructure begins to corrode.

**[INTERNAL MEMORANDUM | ARASAKA EXECUTIVE DIVISION – CLASSIFIED LEVEL 7]**  
**To:** Board-Level Oversight, Internal Security Division, Strategic Market Control  
**From:** Executive Director Hanzo Yamiguchi  
**Subject:** Containment & Counter-Memetic Strategy: Concord Ideological Contagion  
**Timestamp:** [2077.06.26 // 02:39 JST]  

---

**Executive Summary:**  
The proliferation of Concord-aligned sentiment across SubNet underground channels presents a clear and present threat to Arasaka’s socio-cognitive influence sphere within Night City. The memetic payload embedded within Concord spiritual and agrarian messaging is eroding compliance metrics, especially in economically vulnerable and augmentation-fatigued demographics.

We are witnessing:  
- Increased user engagement with non-augment-aligned philosophy.  
- Downtrend in Gen-9 Cyberware Upgrade enrollment.  
- Spikes in "back-to-earth" interest groups.  
- Systematic ridicule of our foodtech products (Corpse-starch meme virality = Tier 4 threat).  
- Growing attraction toward Concord figures (e.g., Ashtar Sheran trending as a “post-human prophet”).

---

**Action Items:**  

1. **Deploy Counter-Memetic Packages (CMPs):**  
   - Initiate Operation *Iron Vine*. Spread disinformation that the Concord is a failed social experiment—utilize fake “defectors” claiming bio-ships are mind-control organisms.  
   - Disseminate imagery of “rotting forest planets” labeled as Concord homeworlds. Pair with dystopian voiceover loops.  

2. **PsyOps Augmentation:**  
   - Infiltrate SubNet with AI-generated “Ascended Survivors” claiming they were abducted and de-augmented by force. Targeted trauma campaigns.  

3. **Influencer Containment:**  
   - Blacklist Concord-sympathetic voices. Consider “soft-dissolution” via social ruin or subtle neuro-targeting via embedded smart-ads.  
   - Monitor hacktivist node: @GhostPatch. High threat. Consider quiet extraction & memory veil protocol.  

4. **Restore Faith in the System:**  
   - Launch new consumer campaign: *Augment Eden*. “Real freedom is more power, not less.” Feature lush bioengineered retreats with in-skin interfaces.  
   - Release a limited-run, lab-grown “organic nostalgia” food line to reassert control over naturalist cravings. Label it “Concorde-Grown™” as a legal parody.

---

**Long-Term Risk Assessment:**  
If left unchecked, Concord ideology may metastasize into an anti-corporate civil awakening. Strategic deterrence must walk the line between plausible deniability and absolute memetic dominance. Any acknowledgment of their value = legitimization.
