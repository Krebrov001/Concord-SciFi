# Khensu's Interrogation

## ⛓️ **Scene: Interrogation Vault 7 – Fort Triumphis, Abydos Primus**  
**Personnel Present:**  
– Commissar Marcus Vrangell  
– Inquisitor Astador Vallan, Ordo Xenos  
– Magos Rhox, Explorator-Prime  
– Interrogation Scribe-Servo 94-K  
– Subject: Designation “Khensu,” captured xeno-humanoid entity

---

The chamber is cold, sterile, lit by harsh lumen strips. Chains clink as Khensu is secured to a reinforced adamantium chair etched with hexagrammatic wards. He is bruised, but still holds himself upright with wounded dignity. His golden armor is scorched, his headpiece missing.

Behind the one-way mirror, **Commissar Vrangell** stands, arms folded, eyes sharp. **Inquisitor Vallan**, gaunt and dressed in black with the rosette of the Ordo Xenos displayed, taps a rune-slate. **Magos Rhox** emits a series of contemplative binharic chirps.

They enter.

### 🔍 **Interrogation Begins**

> **Inquisitor Vallan (calmly):**  
> “Subject. Identify yourself. Species, allegiance, means of transport, and spiritual designation.”

> **Khensu (glaring):**  
> “I am Khensu, loyal servant of Ra, Lord of the Nine Systems.  
> The blood of gods flows through me. You dare to chain a starborn?”

Vrangell snorts.

> **Vrangell:**  
> “Starborn? You crashed into the dirt like a burning dumpster.”

> **Khensu (sneering):**  
> “You claim dominion over a world you do not understand. This is Ra’s world. The people here kneel in proper worship.”

> **Vrangell:**  
> “They kneel now to the **Emperor of Mankind**, as all humans should.”

> **Khensu (confused):**  
> “Your ‘emperor’... another god?”  
>  
> *[A pause]*  
> “You are Jaffa? Mutinous Jaffa, perhaps? Followers of a rival System Lord?”

> **Vallan (flatly):**  
> “We are not ‘Jaffa’. We are **mankind**. You are xenos filth. Possibly parasitic. Possibly technological. Possibly both.”

> **Magos Rhox:**  
> “Preliminary bioscans suggest symbiotic interface at the base of the cerebral stem. Suggests entity may not be the original host.”

Khensu stiffens slightly. But hides it.

> **Khensu:**  
> “I was born divine.”

> **Vrangell:**  
> “Funny. You bleed like a mortal.”

---

### ⚖️ **Cultural Clash and Clarity**

> **Khensu (growing agitated):**  
> “You don’t even know where you are. This is Abydos, gateway of the Netjeru. Your ignorance of the System Lords shall be your end.”

> **Vallan (to Rhox):**  
> “Note the term 'System Lords'. Possibly an interstellar theocracy.  
> Cross-reference with ancient Terran languages—‘Netjeru’ is Egyptian for ‘god’.”

> **Vrangell (snaps fingers):**  
> “Wait. Egyptian? That’s an Old Earth style. From pre-Imperial Terra.  
> This bastard’s wearing knockoff throneworld fashion.”

> **Khensu (offended):**  
> “Your holy world is but a pale shadow of the greatness of Ra’s domain!”

> **Vrangell (grinning):**  
> “He thinks *we’re* the offshoots.”

> **Rhox (clicking rapidly):**  
> “Fascinating. Subject's architecture, language, even religious motifs… are in alignment with pre-Unification Terran history.  
> Possibility: divergent human offshoots seeded across the galaxy during Dark Age of Technology.”

A pause falls. Khensu furrows his brow.

> **Khensu:**  
> “Terra? I have heard this name. An ancient world of primitives lost to time…”

> **Vallan (steely):**  
> “Terra is the **Throneworld**. The seat of humanity. You are not a god.  
> You are a relic. A parasite wearing an ancient costume.”

Khensu's face begins to crack.

> **Khensu (desperate):**  
> “No… I command starships… I was *worshipped* for centuries—”

> **Vrangell (coldly):**  
> “And now you're behind a cell door while a tech-priest studies your underwear for power signatures.”

---

### 📜 **Addendum: Inquisitorial Observation Log**

> **Inquisitor Vallan, Ordo Xenos – Log Entry 347-M40:**  
> “Subject displays traits of significant cultural delusion.  
> Likely descended from early human colonization effort.  
> Entity known as ‘Khensu’ is either a biomechanical parasite exploiting mythological programming, or a post-human cultural relic, dangerously corrupted.”  
>  
> “Recommend extended interrogation. Dissection optional. Further implication: other ‘System Lords’ may exist.  
> Their technology warrants seizure. Their cults warrant purging.”  
>  
> “This may be only the beginning.”

## 🕳️ **Scene: Interrogation Vault 7, Day 3**  
**Subject:** Khensu, Designation: Xeno-Humanus Parasitica  
**Present:**  
– Inquisitor Astador Vallan, Ordo Xenos  
– Interrogator-Gaoler Cyrix Helven  
– Magos Rhox  
– Commissar Marcus Vrangell (observing)  
– Lie-purifier servo-skulls x2  
– Sanctified Confession Engine v.32-C (psy-scrubbed)

---

Khensu is strapped to a metal throne wreathed in circuitry. Electro-induction tendrils snake into his spine, and his wrists are clamped in micro-pulse biometric restraints. He has not eaten nor slept in two days—not due to deprivation, but because the God-King within no longer finds command of his body easy.

His hair is matted. His gold armor hangs in scraps. His eyes dart nervously.

---

> **Inquisitor Vallan (calmly):**  
> “Day Three, Session Four. Begin log.”

> **Gaoler Cyrix (to Khensu):**  
> “We have more of your ship’s logs. We’ve cracked three of your slave dialects.  
> The sanctified lie-purifier will be active. There is no deception. There is only confession.”

> **Khensu (hoarse):**  
> “I… am Khensu… Lord of the Moon Gate… Voice of Ra…”

> **Commissar Vrangell (folding arms):**  
> “No one cares, xeno. Start talking about your so-called ‘System Lords.’”

---

### 🧠 **Truth, Delivered in Madness**

Khensu flinches, then slumps. A flicker of the parasite’s neural glimmer fades behind his eyes. He begins to speak, slowly.

> **Khensu:**  
> “There are dozens… perhaps more.  
> Ra, supreme among them. Then Apophis, Ba’al, Anubis… Setesh, Osiris… each holding dominion over star systems across the galaxy.”

> *[Inquisitor Vallan narrows his eyes.]*

> **Khensu:**  
> “Each world… a copy of the First World. The one you call ‘Earth’… but not your Earth.  
> The gods found these people living on those Earths, bent their knees… **rebuilt empires in their image.**  
> We used the gates. The circular ways. Thousands of them. Ancient. Pre-god, even.”

> **Vallan:**  
> “The gates are not of your making?”

> **Khensu (shaking his head):**  
> “They predate us. Even Ra found them. We mastered their use… but never their origin.”

> **Magos Rhox (binharic chatter):**  
> “Fascinating. Non-originating users. Likely technological scavengers, not true engineers.”

> **Vallan (to skull-servitors):**  
> “Confirm truth-pulse.”

> **Servo-skull 94-K (monotone):**  
> “Pulse stable. Subject believes statement. 89% congruence with stress telemetry.”

> **Khensu:**  
> “We are gods because **they believe** us to be. We ruled for millennia. With fire, and fear, and false memory.”

> **Vrangell (quietly, disturbed):**  
> “You enslaved other human worlds?”

> **Khensu:**  
> “We are not the only ones. The gates lead to **many Earths**… some different.  
> Some with oceans of blood. Others with no stars above. Some with… your face.”

A long silence.

---

## 🧷 **Scene: Interrogation Vault 7, Final Session**  
**Day 5 – Fort Triumphis, Abydos**

Khensu is gaunt, dehydrated, his voice raspy from hours of interrogation. The golden sheen of his eyes flickers, dimmed. The worm within—once proud—has grown silent.

But **Inquisitor Vallan**, **Commissar Vrangell**, and **Magos Rhox** are patient.

---

> **Vallan:**  
> “We are nearly finished. You’ve told us of the System Lords.  
> Now tell us: who built the rings?”

> **Khensu (weakly):**  
> “Not us. Not Ra. The Ancients…  
> Beings of light… long gone before even the first Goa’uld took a host.  
> They made the gates. The citadels. We… we simply walked in, picked up the keys.”

> **Rhox (immediately, binharic excitement):**  
> “Ancient human relic engineers. This confirms it.  
> Goa’uld are not innovators—they are **post-Dark Age scavengers**!”

> **Vrangell:**  
> “So all your shining palaces, your teleporting rings, your staff weapons—**they’re stolen?**”

> **Khensu (ashamed):**  
> “Yes.”

> **Vallan (grim):**  
> “You conquered entire civilizations by pretending to be gods… using stolen technology… brainwashing primitives… and calling that divinity?”

> **Khensu (quiet):**  
> “We told them… we were gods… and then made it true by fear.  
> Ritual, light, death from the skies. They believed, so they obeyed.  
> What is a god but one who is obeyed?”

A long silence.

> **Vrangell (stone-faced):**  
> “The only God is the **Emperor of Mankind**.  
> And He does not ask for obedience. He **demands** it. Across a million worlds.  
> You’re not a god. You’re a worm… inside a coward.”

---

## 🧬 **Verdict: Species Analysis**

> **Rhox (to Vallan):**  
> “Conclusion: subject is a **human host**, genetically post-standard.  
> Inhabited by a serpentine xenoform embedded in the central nervous system.  
> Xenoform class: parasitus-mimeticus.  
> Technology used: ancient human.  
> Cultural method: memetic subjugation via ritual and light weaponry.”

> **Vallan:**  
> “A **civilization of parasites**, grafted onto the body of forgotten human cultures.”

> **Vrangell:**  
> “Worse than heresy. It’s desecration.”

### ⚖️ **The Council of Response – Fort Triumphis Command Sanctum**  
**Attending:**  
– Inquisitor Vallan  
– Commissar Vrangell  
– Governor Lucan Dal Forrix 
– Magos Rhox (via noospheric projection)  
– Astropath Aleyra (silent observer)

---

> **Vallan (rubbing temples):**  
> “The truth has been affirmed. This ‘Goa’uld’ is no xenos species we’ve encountered, but rather… a perverse hybrid.  
> A parasite that **possesses** human hosts and sets itself up as a god.”

> **Governor Dal Forrix:**  
> “So they're human?”

> **Rhox (flatly):**  
> “They are *of* human origin, but **no longer human.** Their biology is desecrated. Their technology non-sanctioned. Their morality absent.”

> **Vrangell:**  
> “We’ve encountered abominable technotheocracies before. But this one spans worlds—**human** worlds. Forgotten brothers, maybe. Or just shadows.”

> **Vallan:**  
> “And they command… hundreds of these worlds, through some ancient network.”

> **Governor Dal Forrix:**  
> “Then we must prepare. Imagine if this ‘Ra’ arrives with a fleet. Or worse, one of these others… Anubis. Ba’al.”

> **Vrangell:**  
> “Let them come. Let them see what true firepower looks like.”

> **Vallan (gravely):**  
> “This is **not** an isolated threat. This is a covert empire, laced through our galaxy like cancer.  
> And worse—*they’ve never encountered the Imperium before.*”

> **Magos Rhox:**  
> “I recommend expansion of Stargate extraction protocols. Technoarchaeological studies suggest these networks may reach far into non-Imperial zones. Possibly near xeno-infested quadrants.”

> **Vallan (nodding):**  
> “Then this world—Abydos—becomes a strategic frontier. A bulwark against an unknown enemy.”  
>  
> *[He slams his seal down.]*  
>  
> “By order of the Ordo Xenos, a campaign of **containment, infiltration, and erasure** shall begin.  
> These ‘System Lords’ must be mapped, monitored, and—eventually—*purged.*”

## 🧾 **Ordo Xenos Report – Inquisitor Vallan**

> **Subject: Khensu of Abydos**  
> Species: Xeno-Parasitic (designate: Goa'uld)  
> Current Status: Detained  
>  
> **Strategic Note:**  
> The Goa'uld System Lords represent a clear and present contamination of human legacy and Dark Age technology.  
> A parasite-culture upon forgotten human offshoots.  
> Xeno-Parasites on the bodies of men, civilizational parasites on the Body of Mankind.
> Primary weapons: psy-illusion, misused relics, memetic cult programming.  
>  
> **Recommended Action:**  
> – Initiate exploratory gate missions.  
> – Map the 'System Lord' hierarchy.  
> – Infiltrate and destabilize their domains.  
> – Classify all Goa'uld as Xeno Abominable.  
> – Prepare exterminatus contingencies.  

> **Final Judgment:**  
> *The Goa’uld are the shadow that walked in the Light of Man.*  
> *We shall bring them fire.*

### **📜 Marcus Vrangell’s Report to the Administratum**

**📌 Classification: Level Magenta — Eyes Only**  
**Author: Commissar Marcus Vrangell, Fort Triumphis, Abydos Prime**

> **To: Departmento Munitorum, Segmentum Command, Ordo Xenos, and Holy Terra.**

> **Subject: Post-Annexation Report – Abydos Prime**

1. **Successful Annexation**  
Abydos Prime has been brought into compliance without sustained resistance. Local humans have displayed perfect obedience and have already begun Ecclesiarchical integration. Infrastructure projects are underway. Naquadah resource extraction is proceeding smoothly.

2. **Xeno-Humanoid Entity Encountered**  
A xeno-humanoid calling itself **Khensu** arrived in orbit with an armed vessel and attempted to reassert dominion over the planet. Forces under my command repelled the attack with no casualties. The xeno was captured and now remains under the care of the Ordo Xenos.

3. **Biological Anomaly — Goa’uld Parasitism**  
Khensu is host to a parasitic xenoform—classified by Mechanicus biologists as a **serpentine neural leech**, interfacing with the central nervous system. This species uses humanoid hosts as vehicles of domination. Their civilization mimics human hierarchy, but is predicated on bodily control and psychological subjugation.

4. **Technological Appropriation**  
Analysis confirms that the Goa’uld parasite-civilization employs **stolen human technology**, most likely remnants of the **Dark Age of Technology**. Their stargate transport system is now believed to be an original DAoT creation, twisted for heretical use.

5. **Conclusion**  
The Goa’uld are not just xeno. They are a **xeno infection**—a parasite of flesh and culture. They infest human legacy and wield our own relics as weapons against us. This cannot stand.

> **Signed,**  
> *Commissar Marcus Vrangell*  
> *Hammer of Abydos*  
> *Protector of the Emperor’s Flame*

### **🏛 High Lords of Terra – The Stargate Crusade Declared**

**Location: The Eternity Gate, Palace of the High Lords, Terra**

The chamber is draped in incense and gold. At the table sit the ancient lords: figures of myth, strategy, and unyielding authority.

> **High Lord Militant Arvis Drax (Astra Militarum):**  
> “This Khensu—his kind are not merely xenos. They are hereteks, blasphemers, false kings in our Emperor’s flesh.”

> **Lord Admiral Semion Benthos (Navis Imperialis):**  
> “A transit system spanning unknown regions… ancient, human-made, perverted. The Goa’uld must be purged. We must burn out the infection at its source.”

> **Elysia Katovar (Ecclesiarchal Voice):**  
> “To let them live is to allow lies to fester in our Emperor’s garden.”

> **Magos Dominus Helivar-Skorr (Mechanicus Delegate):**  
> “We demand salvage rights on all captured stargates and parasite vessels. Their corruption must be reversed… their origin mapped.”

A decision is reached.

> **The High Lords Declare: The Stargate Crusade.**

Its goal: cleanse all Goa’uld-claimed worlds, recover all stargates, and reclaim the birthright of human legacy lost.

Billions of souls will be conscripted. Fleet orders dispatched. The galaxy will burn anew.

### **🔧 Dissection of Khensu’s Crashed Ship**

**Location: Crash Zone Theta-Seven, Abydos Prime**

The Goa’uld ship lies cracked open like a scarab’s shell in the sands.

Mechanicus Explorators, adorned in crimson robes and filament-tendrils, swarm its husk.

> **Magos Rhox (ecstatic):**  
> “Confirmed. Fusion array with neural command interfaces. Sub-plasma transit coils.  
> This is **our** technology… grotesquely repurposed.”

> **Junior Enginseer Ferrik:**  
> “They replaced purity-seals with *golden idols*. Replaced logic engines with *statues of themselves*.”

> **Rhox (coldly):**  
> “Desecration. Every circuit twisted with ego and false glory.”

Servo-skulls record every detail. Hymns are sung in binharic.

> **Rhox (to his acolytes):**  
> “This abomination will be sanctified… and remade. We shall reforge what was stolen.  
> The Ancients were us.  
> And now, we return.”

---

### **🔬 Mechanicus Breakthrough – Decoding the Goa’uld Ship**

**Location: Tech-Cathedral Omnissiah Redivivus, Veritus Prime – Secure Reverse-Engineering Vault**

Servo-skulls dart through the air, scanning the still-cracked fuselage of Khensu’s vessel. Sparks fly as mag-axes and micro-meltas carve open sealed chambers.

A swarm of Tech-Adepts in red robes and chromed augmentations gather around a central platform, where **Magos Rhox** chants in binary.

> **Magos Rhox (excited):**  
> “Divine praise to the Omnissiah. The data-core has yielded! We have *found the interface logic*!”

> **Enginseer Dorrin:**  
> “Is it… human?”

> **Rhox:**  
> “Corrupted. Baroque. Decorated with serpent filigree and unnecessary ornamentation. But the *architecture*… unmistakable. This is DAoT-grade neuro-psionic command latticework.”

He places a gloved hand reverently on a gold-inlaid interface node.

> **Rhox:**  
> “We now understand how they manipulate this ship with thought. A cortical resonance field. A command throne directly wired to the brainstem. Blasphemous—but brilliant.”

> **Lexmechanic Karos:**  
> “Then… we could *replicate* this?”

> **Rhox (smiling grimly):**  
> “No. Not yet. But we can *repurpose* it. And we will learn more. These Goa’uld do not *create*—they *inherit*. And that makes them vulnerable.”

Binary cant rises in tempo.

> **Rhox (to his scribes):**  
> “Begin adapting the cortical relay into an Imperium-compliant framework. Notify Mars. We have *rediscovered* another key of the ancients.”

As servitors hum and cogitators whir, Rhox looks upon the mangled Goa’uld vessel with reverence and disdain.

> **Rhox (softly):**  
> “You stole our past.  
> We will take back our future.”

## 🚮 **Disposition of Subject: Khensu**

Khensu is dumped into a reinforced psy-sealed cell. A sanctified speaker grille buzzes overhead.

- **A recorded sermon plays in endless loop.**
- The words of the **Lectitio Divinitatus**, praise hymns, propaganda reels.
- **Images of Terra, of the Emperor’s golden throne, the burning heretics of Vrax, and the parades of a billion worlds** scroll across an embedded holo-field.

He stares.

His mind spirals.

---

### **📽 Khensu, Alone in His Cell**

The cell is dimly lit—sterile, seamless ceramite walls. A single cogwheel-adorned grille in the ceiling hums with static.

Then the voice begins again.

> **VOX TRANSMISSION:**  
> “In the forty-first millennium, there is only war. But through war, there is salvation.  
> Through the Divine Light of the Emperor, humanity stands unbroken, immortal, eternal.  
> Bow not to false gods. Trust not in alien lies. Worship the One who sits on the Golden Throne.”

Khensu huddles on the cell floor. Eyes sunken. Limbs trembling.

> **Khensu (muttering to himself):**  
> “One God… for an entire galaxy… ruled by corpses and fire.  
> What civilization makes war its faith? What god needs a billion soldiers to speak for Him?”

The holo-display blinks: burning heretics, golden cathedrals, billions prostrating. The gleaming armor of the Adeptus Custodes flashes across the screen, then fades.

> **Khensu (clenching teeth):**  
> “We used *light* to make them bow. They use *fire*.  
> We pretended.  
> They… believe.”

A sobering realization settles over him.

> **Khensu (quietly, almost reverently):**  
> “Perhaps they are… what we claimed to be.”

The screen cuts to an image of Holy Terra, with solemn Gregorian chants echoing.

---

## 💭 **Khensu’s Internal Monologue (Reflection and Dread)**

> *I ruled for centuries. They bowed to me. They feared my name.  
> Ra gave me a system. I bathed in worship. I was eternal…*

> *But these humans…*  
> *…They do not worship me. They do not fear me. They **mock** me.*  
> *And they are…*  
> *greater than I ever imagined. An empire of fire and machines. Gods unto themselves.*  
> *A throne-world of metal. A billion troops. Ships like cities.*  
> *They do not pretend to be gods. They simply are.*

> *We were kings over broken stones.  
> But these ones…  
> These ones are the storm.*  

He huddles in the cell, voice cracking in the stillness:

> **Khensu (to himself):**  
> “What… what happens when **they find Ra?**”
